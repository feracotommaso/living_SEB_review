# Background

## Soft skills

“*Noncognitive skills, a construct that nearly everyone can agree is important but no one can agree on how to measure*.” (Harden, 2021).

-   Heckman: [@heckman2012]

-   OECD: [@oecd2015; @oecd2021]

-   PISA: [e.g., @oecd2017]

-   WEF: [@worldeconomicforum2016; @feraco2022SoftSkillsExtracurricular]

-   NRC: [@robles2012ExecutivePerceptionsTop]

-   SEL: [@WhatCASELFramework]

-   MUR: [@ministryofeducationuniversityandresearchmiur2018LineeGuidaPercorsi]

-   EU: [@europeancommission2016NewSkillsAgenda]

## Putting things together

::::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
**Personality traits** represent characteristics patterns of thinking, feeling, and behaving.

What someone ***tends to do*** across situations.
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
**Soft skills** represent functional capacities to establish and maintain social relationships, regulate emotions, and effectively manage behaviors toward goals and learning.

What someone ***can do*** when the situation calls for it.
:::
:::::

Traits and skills levels can be congruent or discrepant. For instance, an introvert might be able to (at least in some cases) act as a leader or efficiently speak in public.

## From soft to SEB (social, emotional, and behavioral) skills

These represent the abilities to establish and maintain social relationships, regulate emotions, and effectively manage behaviors toward goals and learning [@soto2021TakingSkillsSeriously; @napolitano2021SocialEmotionalBehavioral].

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   **Self-management skills**
-   **Social engagement skills**
-   **Cooperation skills**
-   **Innovation skills**
-   **Emotional resilience skills**
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   **Conscientiousness**

-   **Extraversion**

-   **Agreeableness**

-   **Openness**

-   **Emotional stability**
:::
:::::

These domains clearly parallel the Big Five in terms of their cognitive, affective, and behavioral referents.

## Assessing SEB skills

![](imgs/items.png)

This approach is designed to better align the measurement method with the construct being assessed.

## What we know about SEB skills

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   SEB skills predict achievement

    -   At school
    -   At work

-   SEB domains have differential predictive power

-   Skill-trait mismatches predict well-being

-   Changes in SEB predict changes in outcomes
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Laypeople see changing skills as desirable

-   Changing skills perceived easier than changing traits

-   Especially for teachers!

-   It seems actually possible and more feasible to change skills
:::

# Rationale

Replication crisis, QRPs…what’s the future like for new frameworks?

## State of the things

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**New opportunities**

-   We finally have a new integrative and systematic framework
-   This framework offers a new measurement tool that should better measure skills
-   This framework allows for a distinction between skills and traits
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Old problems**

-   It is hard to remain up-to-date with the literature

-   Meta-analysis and reviews are static, slow, and specific

-   People can select their preferred results to support their hypotheses
:::
:::::

**HOW CAN WE MAKE THIS NEW LINE OF RESEARCH TRULY RELIABLE, ACCESSIBLE, AND SCIENTIFIC?**

## The idea

**A living systematic review and meta-analysis:** By creating an adaptable infrastructure for evidence integration, we hope to support more transparent, efficient, and rigorous scientific progress. This initiative lays the foundation not only for SEB research but also as a model for other emerging fields to follow—advancing toward a new era of living meta-synthesis in psychology.

## Structures and aims

::::: columns
::: {.column width="30%"}
Three core rationales:

-   **Prevent fragmentation**

-   **Enable timely integration**

-   **Advance open science**
:::

::: {.column width="70%"}
Three main aims:

-   **Review aim**: provide a living, organized cartography of SEB literature, freely accessible and filterable;
-   **Meta-analytic aim**: continually synthesize (cross-sectional) associations between SEB skills and all other constructs and variables measured alongside;
-   **Open science aim**: open materials and the Living SEB App to enable replication, rapid evidence checks, preregistration support, and community contributions.

## Search strategy (WOS + Scopus)

-   **Citation-chaining approach:**
    -   **Seminal theoretical papers** [@soto2021TakingSkillsSeriously]
    -   **Measurement and adaptations**
        -   Original measurement paper [@soto2022IntegrativeFrameworkConceptualizing]
        -   Language adaptations [@lechner2022BehavioralEmotionalSocial] [@feraco2024ItalianBehavioralEmotional] [@postigo2024BehavioralEmotionalSocial]
        -   Shorter versions [@sewell2024AssessingSocialEmotional]

## Updating the search

-   The query is replicated every first working day of each month

## Eligibility criteria - review

-   **Review eligibility:** Citations are included in the review synthesis if:

    -   The main topic of the paper is SEB skills.

    -   The paper provides substantial theoretical and quantitative information about SEB skills.

-   **Exclusion from the review.** Citations are completely excluded from the review synthesis if:

    -   They were not focusing on or adopting the SEB skill framework or emerging frameworks based on it.
    -   They were published as books;
    -   They were published in languages that were not comprehensible for the authors;
    -   Refer to the SEB framework, but focus on different frameworks, such as the OECD or CASEL.

## Eligibility criteria - meta-analysis

-   **Meta analysis eligibility.** Citations are included in the meta-analysis if:

    -   The study assessed SEB skills using a validated skill-based assessment referencing to the SEB framework;

    -   The study reports correlations at baseline or the data could be reduced to correlations or obtained by the authors;

    -   The study referred to original data that are not already reported in other included studies;

    -   The population study was either the general population or a clinical population with mild/moderate mental health issues.

## Outcomes

**This review is not limited to any outcome**, but all possible outcomes will be coded and included. Outcomes will be treated in the following way:

-   **Broad category:** Each outcome is assigned to the a broad category. Examples might be skills, mental health, school, demographic variables, job, personality traits...

-   **Second-level category:** Subsequently, within each broad category, each outcome is assigned to a more specific category. For instance, the broad 'traits' category may include the big five, hexaco, character strengths. School may include academic achievement, learning factors.

-   **Specific construct:** Finally, each construct is labeled with its own construct label (e.g., extraversion, self-management).

-   Finalize the app

    -   Possibly find a way to add modules for future development

        -   Longitudinal / intervention data

        -   Non-correlational designs

    -   Add features for other-uploaded data

-   Publication

    -   Who could accept this and in which format?

    -   Why should we publish it?

-   Feasibility

    -   Can I (we) keep updating it forever?

    -   Can we involve the community? How?

-   More? (quality assessment, search string, inclusion criteria..)
