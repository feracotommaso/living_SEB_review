# Social, emotional, and behavioral skills

## Soft skills

“*Noncognitive skills, a construct that nearly everyone can agree is important but no one can agree on how to measure*.” (Harden, 2021).

## A definition

::::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
**Personality traits** represent characteristics patterns of thinking, feeling, and behaving.

What someone ***tends to do*** across situations.
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
**SEB skills** represent functional capacities to establish and maintain social relationships, regulate emotions, and effectively manage behaviors toward goals and learning [@soto2021TakingSkillsSeriously].

What someone ***can do*** when the situation calls for it.
:::
:::::

Traits and skills levels can be congruent or discrepant. For instance, an introvert might be able to (at least in some cases) act as a leader or efficiently speak in public.

## Structure

SEB skills mainly fall into five areas [@soto2021TakingSkillsSeriously; @napolitano2021SocialEmotionalBehavioral] that resemble the Big Five.

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   **Conscientiousness**

-   **Extraversion**

-   **Agreeableness**

-   **Openness**

-   **Emotional stability**
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   **Self-management skills**
-   **Social engagement skills**
-   **Cooperation skills**
-   **Innovation skills**
-   **Emotional resilience skills**

## Measurement: The BESSI

![](imgs/items.png)

This approach is designed to better align the measurement method with the construct being assessed.

## The SEB model

![](imgs/sebmodel.png){fig-align="left" width="100%"}

## What we know about SEB skills

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   SEB skills predict achievement

    -   At school
    -   At work

-   SEB domains have differential predictive power

-   Skill-trait mismatches predict well-being

-   Changes in SEB predict changes in outcomes
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Laypeople see changing skills as desirable

-   Changing skills perceived easier than changing traits

-   Especially for teachers!

-   It seems actually possible and more feasible to change skills
:::
:::::

# Rationale
Replication crisis, QRPs...what's the future like for new frameworks?

## State of the things

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**New opportunities**

-   We finally have a new integrative and systematic framework
-   This framework offers a new measurement tool that should better measure skills
-   This framework allows for a distinction between skills and traits
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Old problems**

-   It is hard to remain up-to-date with the literature

-   Meta-analysis and reviews are static, slow, and specific

-   Emerging fields are rapidly growing with pros, cons, and possible 'conflicts of interests'
:::
:::::

**HOW CAN WE MAKE THIS NEW LINE OF RESEARCH TRULY RELIABLE, ACCESSIBLE, AND CUMULATIVE?**

## The idea

-   We need a way to keep track of new publications -\> just create a database!

-   But that changes daily! -\> ...update it

-   And then? -\> Code and analyze everything!

-   How? -\> By yourself...or we'll find a way to help you

**A living systematic review and meta-analysis:** By creating an adaptable infrastructure for evidence integration, we hope to support more transparent, efficient, and rigorous scientific progress.

## Structures and aims

::::: columns
::: {.column width="30%"}
Three core rationales:

-   **Prevent fragmentation**

-   **Enable timely integration**

-   **Advance open science**
:::

::: {.column width="70%"}
Three main aims:

-   **Review aim**: provide a living, organized cartography of SEB literature, freely accessible and filterable;
-   **Meta-analytic aim**: continually synthesize (cross-sectional) associations between SEB skills and all other constructs and variables measured alongside;
-   **Open science aim**: open materials and the Living SEB App to enable replication, rapid evidence checks, preregistration support, and community contributions.

## Outcomes

This review is not limited to any outcome, but all possible outcomes will be coded and included. Outcomes will be treated in the following way:

-   **Broad category:** Each outcome is assigned to the a broad category. Examples might be skills, mental health, school, demographic variables, job, personality traits...

-   **Second-level category:** Subsequently, within each broad category, each outcome is assigned to a more specific category. For instance, the broad 'traits' category may include the big five, hexaco, character strengths. School may include academic achievement, learning factors.

-   **Specific construct:** Finally, each construct is labeled with its own construct label (e.g., extraversion, self-management).

# Socio-ecological perspectives on school anxiety

## Variability in school anxiety

As far as I know, fine grained spatial variability of students' characteristics has not been study yet. Generally, large international data collections focus on cross-country variability, ignoring within-country variability.

For instance, school anxiety effects seem to vary across continents and countries with adjusted effects that happen to be even positive [@szucsMathsAnxietySubjective2023]!

## Research questions

1.  Does test anxiety vary across Italian municipalities?

2.  How stable are these differences across time?

3.  Does the association between test anxiety and math and reading skills vary across Italian municipalities?

4.  To what extent do municipalities\` key socio-ecological characteristics (e.g., demographic, social, economic, and natural geographic features) relate to this variation?

## Methods

-   **The INVALSI dataset:** INVALSI yearly collects data from [**all Italian schools**]{.underline}. Data from 5^th^ graders collected between 2012/2013 and 2017/2018 (six cohorts of the entire Italian 5^th^ graders population; 3/5 million students).

    -   Test anxiety

    -   Math achievement

    -   Reading achievement

-   **Municipalities**: \~3.000 municipalities (Italy has \~7.000)

    -   demographic (age, gender, population density)
    
    -   social (immigrants share, migration rates, married couples, children)

    -   economic (income, education, job levels)

    -   natural geographic features (altitude, coasts, kmq)
