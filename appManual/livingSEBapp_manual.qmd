<!-- The introduction should not have a level-1 heading such as Introduction. -->

The livingSEBapp (XXXXX LINK XXXX) is a free and open-source Shiny app that allows for data synthesis of peer-reviewed publications that used the Behavioral, Emotional, and Social Skills Inventory (BESSI) in their research. The app should be viewed as a rapid tool for data synthesis, effect size visualization, and Bayesian priors and hypotheses building. It should not be intended as a systematic meta-analysis and its results should not be considered as the output of a complete meta-analysis of the literature (though they should be very similar). To conduct a systematic meta-analysis, the open-source data could be a starting point, but it might be necessary to include additional information (e.g., moderators of interest) and run more detailed and tailored analysis.

Below, the different functions of the app are described to guide the user toward a correct and efficient usage of the livingSEBapp.

# Running a meta-analysis of the associations between SEB domains and their correlates

A first utility of the app is the possibility to run a rapid synthesis of the associations between the five SEB domains and each correlate measured more than one time in the literature. Specifically, the app allows for the estimation of the meta-analytical association between the five SEB domains and one 'outcome' at the time. Multivariate associations are not handled at the moment.

The steps to conduct such analysis are here detailed:

1.  **Select the data of interest:**

    -   Using the tab on the left of the screen, you can select the broad group of outcomes and, within it, the specific outcome you want to analyze. By default, 'schoool' -\> 'academic achievement' is selected as outcome of the meta-analysis. The complete list of outcomes and groupings is available in the matrix codebook.

    -   If you want to filter the data XXXX

    -   Everytime you select and outcome or filter the data, basic information about the data available for the meta-analysis -given the selections- is provided in the main Tab.

    -   When the selection is completed, you can proceed to the next step of the analysis.

2.  **Run the meta-analysis:**

    -   Download a report of the results

3.  **Check forest plots:**
