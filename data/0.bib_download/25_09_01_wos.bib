Abstract = {In this study, we investigated perceived social-emotional competence
   (PSEC) among 373 Australian secondary school students in relation to
   parent ratings of social-emotional skills, and perceived teacher and
   parental autonomy support. Using bifactor exploratory structural
   equation modelling, we examined five dimensions of PSEC (perceived
   competence for assertiveness, tolerance, social regulation, emotion
   regulation, and emotional awareness), identifying a global factor and
   five specific factors. Following that, we employed structural equation
   modelling to investigate links between these global and specific factors
   and five parent-reported social-emotional skills: leadership, cultural
   competence, teamwork, cognitive reappraisal, and capacity for emotional
   reflection. Global PSEC was associated positively with all skills,
   whereas the specific factors were, with one exception, each associated
   with greater parent-rated skill in a corresponding area (e.g.,
   assertiveness with greater leadership skill; emotion awareness with
   reflective skills). Addressing a second aim of the research, we tested
   the extent to which students' perceptions of autonomy support from
   teachers and parents assessed near the start of a school term were
   associated with both students' PSEC and parent-rated skills assessed at
   the end of the term. Autonomy-supportive parenting was positively
   associated with global PSEC. Autonomy-supportive teaching was associated
   with greater levels of two specific factors: perceived competence for
   assertiveness and social regulation. Together, findings hold relevance
   to knowledge and efforts aimed at enhancing social-emotional skills
   among students.},

Journal = {SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {28},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Social, emotional, and behavioral (SEB) skills- also known under labels
   like soft skills, 21st century skills, or social-emotional skills- are
   considered key factors for students' success, well-being, and social
   relationships, among others. However, literature on the topic relied on
   different frameworks and questionable measurement methods. Additionally,
   they usually did not integrate skills into classical self-regulated
   learning (SRL) frameworks. To overcome these limitations, we adopted the
   new integrative SEB framework and measured SEB skills, along with five
   SRL factors (academic self-efficacy, SRL strategies, mastery learning
   goals, growth mindset, and achievement emotions) and three outcomes
   (i.e., self-reported academic achievement, peer acceptance, and life
   satisfaction). Participants were 5,075 Italian high school students (M =
   18.23 years old; SD = 0.95). Our results show that SEB skills are
   associated with almost all SRL factors and outcomes, but when
   considering their specific role (net of other skills and SRL factors),
   no direct associations with self-reported academic achievement emerge,
   supporting the hypothesis that SEB skills' effects on academic outcomes
   might be mainly explained by SRL factors, while specific skills (i.e.,
   social engagement, collaboration, and emotional resilience skills)
   directly influence non-scholastic outcomes. Our results support the
   importance of adopting integrative skills frameworks along with SRL
   frameworks to deeply understand the processes linking skills to outcomes
   in the student population.},

Year = {2025},
Volume = {123},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Disadvantaged students generally perform worse than their more
   advantaged peers. However, some resilient students are able to break
   from this mold and achieve high levels of academic performance. Rooted
   in the Big Five Theory, this study examined the extent to which
   socio-emotional skills (i.e., task performance, openmindedness,
   collaboration, engagement with others, and emotional regulation) are
   associated with academic resilience. Participants were 60,722
   economically disadvantaged students from 31 countries/regions.
   Multilevel logistic regression was conducted. The results indicated that
   the socio-emotional skills of perseverance (task performance), curiosity
   (open-mindedness), and emotional control (emotional regulation) were
   positively associated with academic resilience. Surprisingly,
   cooperation was negatively associated with resilience, while empathy,
   assertiveness and stress resistance were not significantly associated
   with resilience. This study enriches the extant literature by
   demonstrating the critical role of socio-emotional skills in academic
   resilience. Additionally, it offers potential intervention targets that
   might be leveraged to promote resilience among disadvantaged
   populations. Educational relevance statement: Socio-emotional skills
   play a crucial role in fostering academic resilience across the globe.
   Students from disadvantaged backgrounds who exhibit higher levels of
   perseverance (task performance), curiosity (open-mindedness), and
   emotional control (emotional regulation) are more likely to achieve
   better academic outcomes. This study highlights the potential of schools
   to promote academic resilience by developing students' socio-emotional
   skills.},

Abstract = {This study analyzes data from the 2019 OECD Survey on Social and

   Fifteen skills were examined, including assertiveness, cooperation,
   creativity, curiosity, emotional control, empathy, energy, optimism,
   persistence, responsibility, self-control, sociability, stress
   resistance, tolerance, and trust. Using network analysis, this study
   identified that cooperation and optimism were consistently among the
   most central skills, although the degree of their centrality varied
   across different age groups and cities. In contrast, energy showed
   weaker connections to other skills among 10-year-olds but stronger
   connections among 15-year-old in every city. The networks of children
   and adolescents differed in overall structure and in the global strength
   of skill interconnections, both in cross-city and most city-specific
   comparisons. The transition from childhood to adolescence is marked not
   only by differences in the importance of specific skills, but also by
   changes in the interactions among them.},

Abstract = {Soft skills are job-related resources associated with emotions,

Abstract = {This paper aims to map the level of emotional intelligence (EI) among

   analysis, students were further divided into three groups based on their
   self-assessment in the five listed categories. The relevance of
   individual competencies was also compared with employers' requirements
   for career skills. This analysis was based on a survey carried out as
   part of the World Economic Forum in 2023. From the overall assessment,
   it can be concluded that future employees (current students) feel most
   strongly about self-awareness and empathy. On the other hand, they
   should set self-motivation, social skills, and emotional management as

Journal = {SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {28},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUL 21},
Abstract = {Socioeconomic gaps in academic achievement have been widely documented.
   However, whether and to what extent these socioeconomic gaps extend to
   the domain of socio-emotional skills is still relatively underexplored.
   Furthermore, limited research has examined the potential mechanisms that
   might help explain this relationship. To address these gaps, this study
   investigated socioeconomic gaps in socio-emotional skills and whether
   school-based interpersonal relationships may help explain their
   association. The participants were 31,187 10-year-old and 29,798
   15-year-old students from ten cities across nine countries. The Big Five
   framework, which organizes skills into five broad domains and more
   specific facets was used to classify socio-emotional skills. The results
   of multilevel structural equation modeling indicated that socioeconomic
   gaps were present in eight out of the 15 socio-emotional skills more
   specifically, we found socioeconomic gaps in persistence, emotional
   control, empathy, trust, tolerance, creativity, sociability, and
   assertiveness. However, we did not find gaps in self-control,
   responsibility, stress resistance, optimism, cooperation, curiosity, and
   energy. At a broader level, there seem to be more differences in the
   domains of collaboration and social engagement compared to emotion
   regulation and task performance. Empathy, trust, sociability, and
   assertiveness showed the strongest disparities among students from
   different economic strata. School-based interpersonal relationships
   partly explained these gaps. Students from more advantaged families
   experienced more positive school-based interpersonal relationships,
   which in turn, facilitated higher socio-emotional skills. The
   theoretical and practical implications are discussed.},

Title = {Behavioral Variability as a Function of People, Situations, and Their
   Interaction},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 JUL 14},
Abstract = {Behavioral variability has long been a central topic in personality
   psychology. Traditionally, research has focused on differences in mean
   levels of behavior across situations and time, rather than taking a
   situation-specific approach to variability. These approaches neglect
   variability (or the opposite, consistency) within a situation, often
   treating within-situation variability as mere error. This study
   investigates three primary questions involving behavioral variability:
   (a) Is variability a general characteristic of individuals or contingent
   on situational factors? (b) Do situations influence behavioral
   variability either by allowing for more behavioral variability or by
   increasing behavioral consistency? (c) Do personality traits interact
   with situations to affect variability? Utilizing intensive longitudinal
   data from two studies, we developed a novel person-in-situ density
   distribution model to capture person-specific within-situation
   variability. Our findings indicate that behavioral variability is not
   solely a function of individual differences but also significantly
   shaped by situational contexts. Meanwhile, contrary to the strong
   situation hypothesis, which emphasizes that situations tend to constrain
   behaviors, the present study found situations influence behavioral
   variability in both directions, making people more and less variable.
   Finally, personality traits were found to moderate the impact of
   situations on behavioral consistency, suggesting that variability
   reflects the interplay between person and situation factors. These
   results highlight the importance of considering behavioral variability
   within situations, which offers insights into personality dynamics
   rather than exclusively focusing on mean-level analyses. The
   implications of the person-in-situ density distribution model for
   studying person-situation transactions are also discussed.},

Journal = {BIOMIMETICS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {10},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN 12},
Abstract = {Background: Multicultural education and second-language acquisition
   engaged neural networks, supporting executive function, memory, and
   social cognition in adulthood, represent powerful forms of
   brain-inspired multisensory learning. The neuroeducational framework
   integrates neuroscience with pedagogical practice to understand how
   linguistically and culturally rich environments drive neuroplasticity
   and cognitive adaptation in adult learners. Objective: This systematic
   review synthesizes findings from 80 studies examining neuroplasticity
   and cognitive outcomes in adults undergoing multicultural and
   second-language acquisition, focusing on underlying neural mechanisms
   and educational effectiveness. Methods: The analysis included randomized
   controlled trials and longitudinal studies employing diverse
   neuroimaging techniques (fMRI, MEG, DTI) to assess structural and
   functional brain network changes. Interventions varied in terms of
   immersion intensity (ranging from limited classroom contact to complete
   environmental immersion), multimodal approaches (integrating visual,
   auditory, and kinesthetic elements), feedback mechanisms (immediate vs.
   delayed, social vs. automated), and learning contexts (formal
   instruction, naturalistic acquisition, and technology-enhanced
   environments). Outcomes encompassed cognitive domains (executive
   function, working memory, attention) and socio-emotional processes
   (empathy, cultural adaptation). Results: Strong evidence demonstrates
   that multicultural and second-language acquisition induce specific
   neuroplastic adaptations, including enhanced connectivity between
   language and executive networks, increased cortical thickness in
   frontal-temporal regions, and white matter reorganization supporting
   processing efficiency. These neural changes are correlated with
   significant improvements in working memory, attentional control, and
   cognitive flexibility. Immersion intensity, multimodal design features,
   learning context, and individual differences, including age and
   sociocultural background, moderate the effectiveness of interventions
   across adult populations. Conclusions: Adult multicultural and
   second-language acquisition represents a biologically aligned
   educational approach that leverages natural neuroplastic mechanisms to
   enhance cognitive resilience. Findings support the design of
   interventions that engage integrated neural networks through rich,
   culturally relevant environments, with significant implications for
   cognitive health across the adult lifespan and for evidence-based
   educational practice.},

Abstract = {Volitional personality change interventions have been shown to help
   people change their current personality toward their ideal personality.
   Here, we address three limitations of this literature. First, we
   contrast the dominant theoretical perspective of self-improvement with
   self-acceptance as pathways to reduce the discrepancy between current
   and ideal personality. Second, we test how well-being aspects change as
   a by-product of targeting personality. Third, we use a waitlist control
   group to account for expectancy and demand effects. Across three studies
   (combined N = 2,094; 1,044 women, 1,050 men; M-age = 30.74, SDage =
   9.57, range(age) = 18-75), we implemented randomized online
   interventions of self-improvement or self-acceptance over a 3-month
   period, with another follow-up 6 months after baseline and a waitlist
   control group added in Study 2. Across Studies 1 and 2, participants in
   both intervention groups reduced discrepancies between current and ideal
   personality and increased in well-being. In both intervention groups,
   current personality increased, whereas ideal personality remained
   stable. Critically, however, control group participants changed
   similarly, with no significant differences in change compared to
   participants who received the interventions. Study 3 compared different
   control group specifications and highlighted that the intervention
   recruitment framing might have induced selection effects and expectancy
   and demand effects leading to positive changes in neuroticism,
   conscientiousness, and extraversion as well as life satisfaction and
   self-esteem. Thus, we demonstrate both shortcomings of previous
   intervention designs and imprecisions in theoretical frameworks of
   personality change mechanisms. We discuss future directions including
   multimethod studies, measurement advances, and microrandomization of
   intervention components.},

Abstract = {Introduction The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of a
   positive behavior skills development program on adolescents who
   participate in basketball sports schools.Methods Sixty-two adolescent
   athletes (Mage 15.83 +/- 0.37) took part in this educational experiment.
   Participants were randomly selected from 2 basketball sports schools
   chosen from a list of basketball sports schools and divided into
   experimental (n = 30) and control (n = 32) groups. The experimental
   group participants were subjected to the effect of the positive behavior
   skills development program, which aimed to develop positive behavior
   skills among adolescents participating in basketball sports schools,
   including taking responsibility, positive self-evaluation, prosocial
   behavior with teammates, prosocial behavior with opponents, taking
   social responsibility, cooperation, assertiveness, empathy,
   self-control, ability to evaluate and convey emotions, ability to
   utilize one's positive emotional experience, ability to comprehend and
   analyze emotions, and ability to control emotions. Positive behavior
   skills development activities were conducted by one of the researchers
   together with the sports school coaches. At the beginning and end of the
   educational experiment, participants from both the experimental and
   control groups completed the following questionnaires: Personal and
   Social Responsibility Questionnaire, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, The
   Prosocial and Antisocial Behavior in Sport Scale, Social Skills Rating
   System-Secondary Student form, and Schutte Self-Report Inventory.Results
   The positive behavior skills development activities implemented during
   the educational experiment had a positive and statistically significant
   impact on the positive behavior skills of the experimental group
   adolescents.Discussion The findings of the present study could be useful
   for educational programs developers who may consider integrating
   elements of this educational program into wider education systems.},

Abstract = {Many psychological interventions are designed to address specific
   characteristics of socioemotional functioning. This randomized
   controlled trial innovatively examined to what extent effects of such an
   intervention generalize to broader domains. The new socioemotional
   competence training (SECT), designed to improve social and emotional
   functioning and well-being in healthy adults, consists of eight weekly
   2-hr sessions and was conducted in three cohorts. We collected data on
   both specific outcomes that were directly targeted during the training
   (i.e., mindfulness, perceived stress) and broader psychological
   indicators of emotional and social functioning (e.g., self-compassion,
   empathy, perspective taking, well-being) before, during, and after the
   training, with follow-ups after 3 and 12 months. Participants were 166
   young (19-39 years, M = 28.16, SD = 4.7) and older (50-78 years, M =
   63.55, SD = 7.2) healthy German adults (75.2\% female). Of these, 73 and
   54 participants were randomly allocated to the socioemotional competence
   training or to a waitlist control group, respectively. Thirty-nine
   participants were allocated to the last training cohort. Results of the
   mixed effects models showed significant Group-by-Time effects on
   mindfulness (b = 0.28, 95\% CI {[}0.16, 0.40]), perceived stress (b =
   -0.36, 95\% CI {[}-0.56, -0.16]), and well-being (b = 0.43, 95\% CI
   {[}0.09, 0.78]), but no meaningful effects on the other broader
   outcomes. Training effects were stable across 3- to 12-months follow-up.
   The socioemotional competence training yielded specific improvements in
   characteristics that were explicitly and consistently addressed
   throughout the training. This underscores the importance of tailored
   interventions in promoting specific aspects of socioemotional
   well-being. Public Significance Statement This study shows that
   participation in a structured 8-week socioemotional competence training
   improves participants' mindfulness, perceived stress, and well-being for
   up to 1 year after completion. This finding indicates that the
   socioemotional competence training can help healthy adults develop
   social and emotional skills to resiliently manage daily hassles such as
   daily stress or challenging social interactions.},

Journal = {LEARNING AND INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES},

Abstract = {Social-emotional skills are crucial for an individual's development, yet
   there is limited examination regarding which skills are most effective
   for students' learning and well-being, especially from a cross-national
   perspective. This study thus aimed to fill this gap and to identify the
   most important skills in three representative countries in education:
   China, USA, and Finland. Drawing data from OECD Social-emotional Skills
   Survey study, about 20,000 students from three countries (NChina = 7246,
   NUSA = 6434 and NFinland = 5482) were included in this study. The
   Relative Weights Analysis and the Dominance Analysis were conducted to
   identify critical socialemotional skills. Results showed that, after
   controlling for demographical variables, in general, curiosity,
   persistence and responsibility were the most important skills for
   students' learning outcomes, while optimism, energy, and stress
   resistance were the three most crucial skills relating to students'
   well-being. However, there was also context-specific finding for
   achievement: tolerance was critical for US students' academic
   achievement while assertiveness and creativity were most important for
   Chinese students' achievements. These findings have important
   implications for tailored social-emotional skills interventions and
   training programs. Educational Relevance statement: This study provides
   important insights for educational practices by identifying key
   social-emotional skills that influence students{''} learning and
   well-being across different countries. It highlights the consistent
   importance of curiosity, persistence and responsibility, the
   context-specific relevance of tolerance in USA, assertiveness and
   creativity in China, and the universal benefits of optimism, energy, and
   stress resistance for student well-being, suggesting tailored and
   prioritized educational interventions.},

Abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly used to score employment
   interviews in the early stages of the hiring process, but AI algorithms
   may be particularly prone to interviewee faking. Our study compared the
   extent to which people can improve their scores on self-report scales,
   structured and less structured human interview ratings, and AI interview
   ratings. Further, we replicate and extend prior research by examining
   how interviewee abilities and impression management tactics influence
   score inflation across scoring methods. Participants (N = 152) completed
   simulated, asynchronous interviews in honest and applicant-like
   conditions in a within-subjects design. The AI algorithms in the study
   were trained to replicate question-level structured interview ratings.
   Participants' scores increased most on self-reports (overall Cohen's d =
   0.62) and least on AI interview ratings (overall Cohen's d = 0.14),
   although AI score increases were similar to those observed for human
   interview ratings (overall Cohen's d = 0.22). On average, across
   conditions, AI interview ratings converged more strongly with structured
   human ratings based on behaviorally anchored rating scales than with
   less structured human ratings. Verbal ability only predicted score
   improvement on self-reports, while increased use of honest defensive
   impression management tactics predicted improvement in AI and less
   structured human interview scores. Ability to identify criteria did not
   predict score improvement. Overall, these AI interview scores behaved
   similarly to structured human ratings. We discuss future possibilities
   for investigating faking in AI interviews, given that interviewees may
   try to ``game{''} the system when aware that they are being evaluated by

Abstract = {With the widespread use of social media, online social experiences have
   become increasingly influential on the mental health of young people.
   However, how individuals' socio-emotional skills modify these
   experiences remains unclear. This study conducted a survey of 1,422
   Chinese university students and applied network analysis and latent
   profile analysis to explore the relationship between socio-emotional
   skills and online social experiences. The results showed that
   socio-emotional skills had a significant positive correlation with
   positive online social experiences and a significant negative
   correlation with negative online social experiences. Among these skills,
   stress resilience may serve as a key dimension for enhancing overall
   socio-emotional competence. Therefore, interventions targeting stress
   resilience could be particularly effective in helping individuals
   strengthen their broader socio-emotional skills, thereby improving their
   online social experiences. Additionally, the study found that positive
   and negative online social experiences are two distinct constructs,
   suggesting that intervention strategies should address them separately.
   These findings provide a theoretical foundation for developing targeted
   interventions to improve young people's online social experiences and
   promote their mental well-being.},

   perspectives on long-term reciprocal relationships},
Journal = {CONTEMPORARY EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {81},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {For decades, the feedback teachers give to students has been discussed
   as one of the most powerful predictors of students' motivation and
   achievement. Previous studies have suggested that the type of feedback
   and its degree of elaboration, immediacy, and relatability are central
   to its effectiveness. However, these factors explain only some of the
   variability in the effects of feedback on students' motivation and
   achievement. Thus, more recent work has proposed a shift toward models
   that more strongly emphasize the role of the student in the
   effectiveness of feedback. In this study, we answer the call for a
   stronger focus on the student when investigating the long-term interplay
   between students' perceptions of teacher feedback and students'
   motivation and achievement by using rich data from 2,121 German lower
   secondary school students who were repeatedly assessed in Grades 5 to 7.
   More specifically, we used full-forward cross-lagged panel models
   (FF-CLPMs) and random intercept cross-lagged panel models (RI-CLPMs) to
   investigate reciprocal relationships between students' perceptions of
   different types of teacher feedback (i.e., at the self-level, the
   process level, and the self-regulation level) and students' selfconcept,
   intrinsic value, and achievement in mathematics. By considering these
   variables simultaneously, we found evidence of associations between
   prior self-concept, intrinsic value, achievement, and perceptions of
   different forms of subsequent teacher feedback. Furthermore, we found
   that prior perceptions of feedback were positively related to subsequent
   self-concept. Our results underscore the need to more thoroughly
   investigate how feedback is longitudinally and reciprocally related to
   students' motivation and achievement.},

Abstract = {Introduction and objective: The article addresses the question of what
   kind of personality model is needed for positive clinical psychology and
   proposes an answer. First, the requirements for such a model were
   formulated, followed by an analysis of personality models in the DSM-5
   and ICD-11 regarding their applicability to positive clinical
   psychology. As a result, issues were identified that the Circumplex of
   Personality Metatraits seems to address. Materials and methods: Five
   requirements for a personality model useful in positive clinical
   psychology were articulated: (1) integration of knowledge from positive
   clinical psychology and personality psychology, (2) relative
   independence from theoretical paradigms, (3) applicability of the model
   in diagnosis, (4) applicability of the model in therapy, and (5)
   applicability of the model in positive interventions and prevention.
   Results: Personality models based on the Big Five introduced in the
   DSM-5 and ICD-11 for the conceptualisation and diagnosis of personality
   disorders can be interpreted as an application of the principles of
   positive clinical psychology in this area. However, these models (1)
   inherit certain issues associated with the Big Five in personality
   psychology, and (2) their application to clinical psychology introduces
   additional problems, which means they fail to meet the formulated
   requirements for such a model, thereby limiting their potential for
   positive clinical psychology. Conclusions: The Circumplex of Personality
   Metatraits overcomes these problems, aligns well with the principles of
   positive clinical psychology, and meets the specified requirements for a
   model needed in this field.},

Journal = {PERSPECTIVES ON MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {14},

Abstract = {Introduction: When considering personal characteristics in undergraduate
   medical admission, professional prequalification (i.e., previous work
   experience in the medical field) and performance on situational
   judgement tests (SJTs) are prominent criteria. Despite evidence on the
   ability of professional prequalification and SJT performance to predict
   general interpersonal skills, their benefit for students' concrete
   behavior in everyday situations remains unclear. Methods: With the
   present study, we examined how undergraduate medical students with prior
   professional qualification and students with better SJT performance act
   in actual social situations by using a behavior-focused observer
   approach. Supervisors rated the students after a mandatory one-week
   practical training in general medicine on three distinguishable
   interpersonal dimensions, namely agency (i.e., assured-dominant),
   communion (i.e., warm-agreeable), and emotional stability (i.e., calm
   and stable). Prior to admission, participants (N = 210) completed a
   traditional SJT (i.e., HAM-SJT), a natural science test (i.e., HAM-Nat),
   and responded to sociodemographic questions. Results: Controlling for
   cognitive admission criteria, age, and gender, students with prior
   professional qualifications were rated as more assured-dominant (/3 =
   0.21; 95\% CI {[}0.04; 0.39], p = 0.019), whereas students with better
   HAM-SJT performance were rated as more warm-agreeable (/3 = 0.17, 95\%
   CI {[}0.02; 0.31], p = 0.024). Discussion: The results value both
   admission criteria as complements to cognitive criteria in undergraduate
   selection but emphasize their differentiated focus on students'
   interpersonal behavior. Medical schools are invited to review their
   admission criteria based on the present findings and on the question of
   required and learnable skills.},
