Abstract = {Personality traits and social, emotional, and behavioral (SEB) skills
   are closely related but incrementally predict life outcomes. This
   implies that although tightly connected, what a person tends to do
   (personality traits) and what they are capable of doing (skills) are not
   always perfectly aligned. In this study, we investigated whether matches
   and mismatches between traits and skills predict important life
   outcomes. We studied a diverse sample of high school students (N = 840)
   who self-reported their Big Five personality traits, five SEB skill
   domains, and an array of academic, social, and emotional outcomes. Using
   response surface analysis, we found that matching trait/skill levels did
   not confer a unique benefit for adolescents over the additive effects of
   traits and skills. In contrast, we found that trait/skill mismatches
   predicted outcomes, and in some cases, adolescents with mismatching
   trait/skills had the best and worst outcomes. Specifically, youth with
   higher skill levels relative to their traits reported better outcomes,
   and those with lower skills relative to their traits reported worse
   outcomes. Our findings provide insights into functioning that are missed
   by solely focusing on direct effects and show that SEB skills can
   enhance youth's personality strengths and buffer against shortcomings.},

Abstract = {Teachers' social and emotional competences (SEC) are important both for

   to adapt it and validate it for primary school teachers, in Catalan
   language. A total of 143 teachers responded to a sociodemographic
   questionnaire, to an adaptation of the TRUST for primary school teachers
   (TRUST-PS), and to an emotional intelligence questionnaire (TEIQue-SF).
   The results revealed that the TRUST-PS has an adequate internal
   consistency for their two subtests: emotion regulation (alpha = .83) and
   relationship management (alpha = .87). Also, a two-factor model showed
   good fit to the data. In conclusion, the TRUST-PS can be used to
   directly assess primary school teachers' SEC and be helpful for
   designing or evaluating teacher trainings.

Abstract = {Recent research has examined similarities and differences between traits
   and skills. It may be the case that traits and skills can be measured
   interchangeably with one providing little to no incremental validity
   over the other. However, methodological limitations constrain our
   ability to draw firm conclusions. Work in this area thus far has only
   examined self-reports and single-stimulus Likert items. We carried out
   two studies to try to determine the extent to which methodology
   influences observed trait-skill similarity. In Study 1, we collected
   both self- and observer-reports of traits and skills, and in Study 2, we
   used both Likert and forced choice items. We examined whether
   trait-skill similarity in scores and validity evidence varied according
   to rater and item type. Our findings suggest that trait-skill similarity
   is unaffected by rater but is affected by item type; forced choice items
   lend themselves to greater trait-skill similarity.},

Title = {Inequalities in adolescents' social, emotional, and behavioral skills:
   Differences across social categories and their intersections},
Journal = {LEARNING AND INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {118},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This paper explores inequalities in adolescents' social, emotional, and
   behavioral skills. We examine whether skills vary by gender, parental
   education, immigrant background, school track-and their intersections.
   In two samples of German adolescents (age 14-20y; N = 3162), we fielded
   the Behavioral, Emotional, and SelfRegulatory Skills Inventory (BESSI),
   enabling a fine-grained assessment of 32 skill facets from five domains.
   Analyses revealed skill advantages for youth whose parents completed
   academic education and youth without immigrant background across most
   skills. Gender and school track had more varied effects mostly in favor
   of girls and adolescents attending academic tracks. Inequalities tended
   to be most pronounced for Innovation Skills. Intersectional analyses
   suggested that skill inequalities across intersectional strata (i.e.,
   combinations of social categories) arose primarily from main effects of
   social categories, rather than intersectional interactions. We conclude
   that inequalities in SEB skills are small but systematic and unfold
   primarily as main effects. Educational relevance and implications: Our
   research explored whether adolescents differ in their levels of social,
   emotional, and behavioral (SEB) skills depending on their gender,
   immigrant background, parents' education, and school track. We found
   that parents' education and immigrant background were the factors
   generating most consistent inequalities in SEB skills, with skill
   advantages for adolescents whose parents completed academic education
   and autochthonous adolescents across all skill domains and most skill
   facets, especially in Innovation Skills (e.g., information processing,
   creative skill, abstract thinking skill). Gender differences and, to a
   lesser extent, differences by school track were also present but more
   varied in terms of which subgroup showed skill advantages: On most
   skills, girls showed skill advantages over boys (with the exception of
   Emotional Resilience), as did and adolescents attending an academic
   school track over those attending a vocational track. We further
   established that inequalities in SEB skills mainly arise from the simple
   effects of the social categories, rather than through complex
   interactions among their intersections. Our findings constitute a step
   towards helping educators, policymakers, and researchers identify groups
   of adolescents who are at a heightened need of support in developing SEB
   skills. This may help in developing targeted interventions and policies
   aimed at fostering equitable development of SEB skills in the future.
   Addressing these inequalities is essential for reducing educational gaps
   and enhancing the academic success and wellbeing of all students.},

Abstract = {Developing social-emotional skills is crucial for all children and
   adolescents, particularly those experiencing social and emotional
   difficulties. This study used network analysis to identify the central
   skills and network association of different social-emotional skills and
   investigated how these networks differ between childhood and
   adolescence. Data were obtained from the 2019 Survey on Social and
   Emotional Skills by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and
   Development. Our study focused on the bottom quartile of participants
   aged 10 and 15 years, including 7737 and 7439 individuals from each age
   group. Optimism and cooperation consistently emerged as the central
   skills of social-emotional competence across both age groups. When
   comparing network structures, there was a significant difference between
   children and adolescents. The connectivity of social-emotional networks
   was stronger among adolescents, indicating closer skill associations.
   Understanding these developmental differences is important for educators
   and practitioners to more effectively support the social-emotional
   development of children and adolescents experiencing social-emotional

Abstract = {Soft skills are key factors for success in multiple contexts of daily
   life, as well as for life satisfaction, but little is known about their
   role in late adulthood and older age. In this study, we aimed to
   investigate the relationships of soft skills, as defined by the World
   Economic Forum, with two indicators of successful/healthy aging: life
   satisfaction and cognitive reserve. A sample of 435 adults aged 50 and
   over completed self-reported measures of soft skills, life satisfaction,
   and cognitive reserve. As control, fluid (reasoning) and crystalized
   (vocabulary) intelligence were assessed too, along with
   socio-demographic characteristics. A series of regression analyses
   showed that soft skills were positively related to both life
   satisfaction and, to a lower extent, cognitive reserve, above and beyond
   gender, age, and both fluid and crystallized intelligence.
   Interestingly, these associations were independent from participants'
   age. Overall, these results highlight the importance of considering soft
   skills also over the middle-late adult life course, due to the potential
   role of these individual qualities in supporting an individual's
   well-being and an active and engaged lifestyle, with implications for
   the promotion of a healthy aging.},

Abstract = {Individuals with rare skeletal disorders like Multiple Osteochondromas
   and Ollier Disease often experience physical and psychological burdens.
   Adventure therapy, with activities like sailing in outdoor settings,
   promotes personal growth and psychological well-being, potentially
   improving health-related quality of life (HRQoL). This study aimed to
   evaluate the impact of a sailing program on health-related quality of
   life and participant satisfaction in individuals with Multiple
   Osteochondromas and Ollier Disease. A quasi-experimental one-group
   pre-post design was employed, with HRQoL assessed using the EQ-5D (R)
   instrument and participant satisfaction measured via a feedback survey.
   Data were collected before and after the five-day sailing program
   conducted in the Mediterranean Sea in 2022 and 2023, involving
   participants diagnosed with Multiple Osteochondromas and Ollier Disease.
   Statistical analyses were performed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test
   and McNemar's test for paired data. A significance level of p < 0.05 and
   p < 0.10 was considered. A total of 25 participants, predominantly male
   (52\%), with a median age of 16 years (ranking from 11 to 31), were
   included in the study. The sailing program had mixed impact on HRQoL.
   Specifically, individuals who were female (p = 0.03), aged 16 and older
   (p = 0.04), with higher educational attainment (p = 0.10) or stronger
   self-management (p = 0.09), resilience (p = 0.01) and self-engagement (p
   = 0.09) skills experienced enhanced HRQoL. Conversely, other
   participants exhibited an increase in self-care difficulties (p = 0.02)
   and a trend towards worsening pain/discomfort (p = 0.38). Overall
   satisfaction with the program was high, with 90\% of participants
   expressing satisfaction. This is the first study which examined HRQoL in
   Multiple Osteochondromas and Ollier Disease patients within an outdoor
   adventure therapy setting. Findings suggest that adventure therapy,
   integrated into healthcare strategies, may offer a valuable complement
   to conventional treatments for rare skeletal disorders. Future research,
   including randomized controlled trials, are necessary to confirm these
   results and develop robust interventions for improving the well-being in
   this population.},

   diverse body of research, addressing two research aims: First, we
   examined the comparative strength of different variables related to
   self-beliefs. Second, we provide a methodological review of
   meta-analyses in this area, thereby facilitating readers' ability to
   assess the risk of bias when interpreting the results. We summarized 105
   first-order meta-analyses published before July 2023 that investigated
   variables associated with self-beliefs during K-12 education, comprising
   493 first-order effect sizes based on more than 8,500 primary studies
   and more than 16 million children and adolescents. We computed
   second-order standardized mean differences (SMD) using two-level
   meta-analyses with robust variance estimation. Personal characteristics
   (SMD = 0.50) showed stronger relations with self-beliefs than
   interventions (SMD = 0.27). Achievement (SMD = 0.66) and noncognitive
   variables (SMD = 0.67) were the personal characteristics most strongly
   related to self-beliefs compared to cognitive abilities (SMD = 0.30) and
   background variables (SMD = 0.21). Interventions targeting individual
   characteristics (SMD = 0.35) and especially self-beliefs (SMD = 0.52)
   showed larger effect sizes than interventions that focused on improving
   teaching and classroom structure (SMD = 0.20). Few meta-analyses
   investigated situational aspects, such as the geographical origin of the
   sample, in association with children's and adolescents' self-beliefs.
   Overall, this second-order meta-analytic review provides a comprehensive
   map of correlates of the self, highlighting pathways for future
   research.},

Title = {Assessing key soft skills in organizational contexts: development and
   validation of the multiple soft skills assessment tool},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {15},
Month = {OCT 25},
Abstract = {Introduction: Soft skills, also known as transversal skills, have gained
   significant attention in the organizational context due to their
   positive impact on various work-related outcomes. The present study
   aimed to develop and validate the Multiple Soft Skills Assessment Tool
   (MSSAT), a short self-report instrument that evaluates interpersonal
   skills (initiative-resourcefulness, assertiveness, conflict management),
   interpersonal communication skills, decision-making style (adaptive and
   maladaptive), and moral integrity.
   Methods: The scale development process involved selecting and adapting
   relevant items from existing scales and employing a cross-validation
   approach with a large sample of workers from diverse organizational
   settings and job positions (N=639). In the first step, 28 items were
   carefully chosen from an item pool of 64 items based on their content,
   factor loadings, item response theory analyses, differential item
   functioning, and fit statistics. Next, the structure of the resulting
   scale was evaluated through confirmatory factor analyses.
   Results: The MSSAT demonstrated gender invariance and good reliability
   and validity. The results of a network analysis confirmed the
   relationships between soft skills and positive work-related outcomes.
   Notably, interpersonal communication skills and moral integrity emerged
   as crucial skills.
   Discussion: The MSSAT is a valuable tool for organizations to assess the
   soft skills of their employees, thereby contributing to design targeted
   development programs.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 OCT 24},
Abstract = {While personality trait assessments are widely used in candidate
   selection, coaching, and occupational counseling, little published
   research has systematically compared occupations in personality traits.
   Using a comprehensive personality assessment, we mapped 263 occupations
   in self-reported Big Five domains and various personality nuances in a
   sample of 68,540 individuals and cross-validated the findings in
   informant ratings of 19,989 individuals. Controlling for age and gender,
   occupations accounted for 2\%-7\% of Big Five variance in both
   self-reports and informant reports. Most occupations' average Big Five
   levels were intuitive, replicated across rating methods, and were
   consistent with those previously obtained with a brief assessment in a
   different sociocultural context. Often, they also tracked the
   Occupational Information Network database's work style ratings and
   clustered along the International Standard Classification of
   Occupation's hierarchical framework. Finally, occupations with higher
   average levels of the personality domains typically linked to better job
   performance tended to be more homogeneous in these domains, suggesting
   that jobs with higher performing incumbents are often more selective for
   personality traits. Several personality nuances had intuitive
   occupational differences that were larger than those of the Big Five
   domains (explaining up to 12\% variance) and replicated well across
   rating methods, providing more detailed insights into how job incumbents
   vary in personality. We provide an interactive application for exploring
   the results (https://apps.psych.ut.ee/JobProfiles/) and discuss the
   findings' theoretical and practical implications.},

Journal = {CHILDREN AND YOUTH SERVICES REVIEW},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {166},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The relationship between early school- and family-related factors and
   later psychological well-being (PWB) has been insufficiently studied. To
   address this gap, a comprehensive model was employed to investigate the
   effects of school and family predictors (ages < 14) on PWB, and a
   related construct, life satisfaction (LS), at age 35 for a large urban
   childhood cohort. 30-year follow-up data were analyzed for 72 \% (N =
   1,112) of the original 1,539 participants (93 \% Black) in the Chicago
   Longitudinal Study, a prospective investigation on the impact of an
   early childhood education program. Hierarchical linear regression
   analysis revealed both parent (beta = 0.51p = 0.013) and student
   educational attainment expectations (beta = 1.48; p = 0.032) as well as
   peer social skills (beta = 0.25; p = 0.003) were the most significant
   predictors of midlife PWB. Peer social skills (beta = 0.02; p = 0.032),
   school mobility (beta = -0.09; p = 0.012), and student educational
   attainment expectations (beta = 0.17; p = 0.022) were strongly
   associated with midlife LS. Sex differences were also examined.
   Implications for shaping key components of school-family programs,
   services, and policies that foster positive development across different
   social ecologies are discussed. Further research should explore the
   mediational pathways to better understand the mechanisms behind these
   observed relationships.},

Title = {Developing the Short Form of the Survey on Social and Emotional Skills

Journal = {JOURNAL OF PERSONALITY ASSESSMENT},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 OCT 11},
Abstract = {Given the critical role of socio-emotional skills in students' academic
   success, psychological well-being, and other critical life outcomes, the
   Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) developed
   the Survey on Social and Emotional Skills (SSES) to measure these skills
   among school-age students. However, the broad conceptual scope of
   socio-emotional skills necessitated the use of a large number of items
   (i.e., 120 items) in the original SSES, which poses challenges regarding
   survey administration and participant fatigue. To address these issues,
   this study aimed to develop a short form of the SSES (i.e., SSES-SF).
   The sample included 29,798 15-year-old students across 10 regions. We
   developed a 45-item version of SSES-SF using the machine learning
   approach of genetic algorithm, which is 62.5\% shorter than the original
   120-item SSES. The reliability, construct validity, reproduced
   information, concurrent validity, and measurement invariance of the
   SSES-SF were investigated. We found that the SSES-SF demonstrated
   satisfactory reliability, construct validity, and concurrent validity.
   Furthermore, the SSES-SF was able to reproduce a substantial amount of
   information from the original full-form SSES and exhibited measurement
   invariance across genders, regions, and language groups. Theoretical and
   practical implications of the findings are discussed.},

Title = {The Zero-Sum Mindset},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {127},
Number = {4},
Pages = {758-795},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Seeing a situation as a zero-sum game, where one party's success must
   come at the expense of another, stifles cooperation-even when such
   cooperation could greatly benefit both parties. Consequently, zero-sum
   beliefs can undermine progress when cooperation is needed for success.
   In this article, we propose that zero-sum thinking (any specific
   instance of zero-sum construals or beliefs) can also be understood as a
   broader mindset-a generalized belief about how the world works. Thus,
   the zero-sum mindset predisposes one toward zero-sum thinking, and its
   cognitive and strategic consequences, across situations and domains. In
   an investigation spanning six countries (Belgium, India, Italy,
   Pakistan, the United Kingdom, and United States) on three continents,
   and more than 10,000 unique participants, we use cross-sectional,
   longitudinal, and experimental methods to provide foundational evidence
   for the zero-sum mindset. In Studies 1-5 (Concept), we show that the
   zero-sum mindset is distinct from existing concepts, stable over time,
   and predictive of disparate instances of zero-sum thinking and its
   strategic implications across domains and cultures. In Studies 6-7
   (Cognitions), we show that zero-sum configurations of success promote
   hostile interpretations of others and that the zero-sum mindset predicts
   this bias even in objectively non-zero-sum situations. In Studies 8-9
   (Consequences), we show that the zero-sum mindset predicts lower
   cooperation even in situations where cooperation is a matter of life or
   death. These findings call attention to the way lay game theories such
   as the zero-sum mindset bear critical implications for the cognitions
   and attitudes that drive social behavior and success.},

Abstract = {The role of non-cognitive skills in academic achievement has garnered
   increasing attention in educational research. This study explores the
   impact of non-cognitive skills on academic achievement in STEM and
   non-STEM subjects in secondary education. Survey data from 795 teachers

   to examine the impact of 26 non-cognitive skills on performance in math,
   physics, first language, and history. Regression and mediation analyses
   were conducted to investigate how students' self-assessment of
   non-cognitive skills directly affects academic achievement and how these
   effects are mediated by teachers' assessments. The findings indicate
   that non-cognitive skills exhibit varying direct and total effects, with
   mediated effects showing greater consistency across different subjects.
   In math and physics, information processing skill and grit show the
   strongest direct and total effects on academic achievement. In first
   language and history, responsibility management and teamwork skill are
   most influential. Except for capacity for optimism and growth mindset,
   all skills demonstrated mediated effects across the four subjects. This
   research informs curriculum development and equitable policies by
   showing how non-cognitive skills impact academic performance across
   subjects. It studies the case of Kazakhstan, adding to global education

Title = {Predicting undergraduate OSCE performance using traditional and
   construct-driven situational judgment tests at admission},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN HEALTH SCIENCES EDUCATION},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 SEP 30},
Abstract = {Situational Judgement Tests (SJTs) are popular to screen for social
   skills during undergraduate medical admission as they have been shown to
   predict relevant study outcomes. Two different types of SJTs can be
   distinguished: Traditional SJTs, which measure general effective
   behavior, and construct-driven SJTs which are designed to measure
   specific constructs. To date, there has been no comparison of the
   predictive validity of these two types of SJTs in medical admission.
   With the present research, we examine whether the HAM-SJT, a traditional
   SJT, and the CD-SJT, a construct-driven SJT with an agentic and a
   communal scale, administered during undergraduate medical admission can
   predict OSCE (i.e., objective structured clinical examination)
   performance in a low-stakes (nLS = 159) and a high-stakes (nHS = 160)
   sample of medical students. Results showed a moderate positive relation
   between the communal scale of the CD-SJT and performance in OSCE
   stations with trained patients in the high-stakes sample (r =.20, p
   =.009). This SJT had also an incremental value in predicting the OSCE
   performance above and beyond GPA (i.e., grade point average), a science
   test (i.e., HAM-Nat), and gender (ss = 0.18, 95\% CI {[}0.03; 0.33], p
   =.020). That is, individuals who chose more communal behavioral
   responses in the SJT were rated more favorably in interactions with
   trained patients in the OSCE. A comparable correlation coefficient was
   observed for the HAM-SJT when controlling for range restriction due to
   admission (rraw = 0.14 vs. rcontrolled = 0.20). Our research provides a
   first indication for the predictive validity of construct-driven SJTs in
   high-stakes undergraduate medical admission.},

   most robustly positively associated with self-management skills. Sense
   of purpose also was associated with better student wellbeing (life
   satisfaction, college satisfaction, and student connectedness), though
   it was inconsistently associated with reported likelihood of degree
   completion. Sense of purpose largely remained a significant correlate of

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PERSONALITY},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 SEP 17},
Abstract = {Whereas meta-analytic evidence has accumulated about the important role
   personality characteristics such as the Big Five traits play for
   academic performance in secondary school, less is known about the
   specific behavioral and emotional repertoire that drives these
   associations. A closer look at the facet-level of Big Five traits can
   provide this knowledge helping to better understand why students differ
   in their success at school. We therefore studied associations between
   Big Five facets and academic performance (grades and standardized test
   scores in German and mathematics) in three independent secondary student
   samples (Study 1 N = 3866, Study 2 N = 2290, and Study 3 N = 366), using
   regression analytic, structural equation modeling, and meta-analytic
   procedures to test facet-level associations and incremental associations
   above traits. We found facet-differential associations with academic
   performance indicators, particularly for facets of conscientiousness,
   openness, and extraversion. Evidence for incremental effects of facets
   beyond traits was weak. Self-discipline (conscientiousness) was the only
   facet that consistently showed incremental effects across Samples 1 and
   2. The results can stimulate research and practice to identify the
   underlying mechanisms that drive these associations and also highlight
   the specific emotional and behavioral repertoire that should be
   supported to help students to succeed in school.
   People differ in the way they act, think, and feel-their personality
   traits-and these trait differences have been shown to be predictive for
   how well students perform in school. Besides findings on the broader
   trait level, less is known about which specific behavioral and emotional
   repertoire might drive these associations. A closer look at the narrower
   facet-level can provide this knowledge helping to better understand why
   students differ in their success at school. We therefore studied
   associations between personality facets and academic performance (grades
   and standardized test scores in German and mathematics) in three
   independent secondary student samples (Study 1 N = 3866, Study 2 N =
   2290, and Study 3 N = 366) and integrated these findings later on.
   Particularly, we wanted to know whether facets can explain differences
   in academic performance above what is explained by broader traits. We
   found evidence for facet-specific associations with grades and test
   scores; however, evidence for explanations of facets above traits was
   weak. Self-discipline was the only facet that explained differences
   above what is explained by the broader trait conscientiousness.},

Title = {The impact of adolescents' voice through an online school radio: a
   socio-emotional learning experimental project},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},
Month = {SEP 6},
Abstract = {Universal school-based socio-emotional learning (SEL) programs for
   adolescents have shown their efficacy in producing positive outcomes.
   The aim of the current study is to present an original school-based
   program and project for adolescents-Semear Valores On-air - and to
   assess the relationship between participation in the project and
   students' socio-emotional skills. Based on the character strengths and
   virtues model, this online school radio project aimed at promoting
   communication, creative thinking, adaptability, and resilience skills in
   adolescents and giving them the opportunity to become influential agents
   of well-being and citizenship. As part of the school curriculum,
   students were invited to create and record radio shows and podcasts. An
   online school radio was thus created, and it continues to broadcast all
   over the world, with music, daily shows, and interviews 24/7. It was
   developed within the framework of the Gulbenkian Academies for
   Knowledge, a nationwide Portuguese program, that seeks to prepare
   children and youth for change, to enable them to deal with complex
   problems, and to expand their opportunities for achievement. A
   quasi-experimental design, with a mixed qualitative-quantitative
   approach was used to analyze data collected from 112 adolescents in the
   second year of its implementation, in 2020-2021. Results suggest that
   (1) teachers' perceptions of student's socio-emotional skills in the
   post test showed more positive associations with the participation in
   the project, than participant's perceptions; (2) students identified
   eight types of lessons learned, the one most referred was the
   improvement of socio-emotional skills and learning about themselves; and
   (3) the combined opportunities for adolescents to learn more about
   themselves, to express themselves and to practice socio-emotional skills
   are important ingredients for their motivation and active engagement in
   the project. Overall, these results indicate that participation in the

Journal = {LEARNING AND INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {115},

Abstract = {This longitudinal study investigated to what extent five key
   social-emotional skills persistence, academic buoyancy, curiosity,
   social engagement, and lack of loneliness were associated with
   adolescents' school engagement and burnout at two timepoints.
   Furthermore, the role of gender and socioeconomic status were examined.
   The data were collected from 1021 adolescents (ages 12-14) in the fall
   of 2021 and 2022. The results were analyzed using structural equation
   modeling (SEM) and revealed that, in general, social-emotional skills
   were associated with higher school engagement and lower burnout among
   adolescents. Curiosity showed a strong relationship with school
   engagement. Moreover, persistence was associated with an increase in
   school engagement among adolescents with low-average socioeconomic
   status. High academic buoyancy and lack of loneliness were associated
   with decrease in burnout over the school years. The study implies that
   recognizing the variety of adolescent's social-emotional skills may help
   to better support adolescents' school engagement and protect them from
   burnout. Educational relevance and implications statement: According to
   the study findings, social-emotional skills, such as persistence and
   curiosity, were associated with higher school motivation and lower
   burnout of adolescents. These results suggest that interventions aiming
   to develop adolescents' social-emotional skills may promote adolescents'
   motivation. Supporting adolescents' social relationships in school may
   also protect adolescents from burning out. To better support adolescent
   students' motivation and well-being at school it is important to
   recognize the diversity of individual adolescents' needs and strengths
   in social-emotional skills. Therefore, sufficient education and training
   would be needed for teachers concerning the variety of social-emotional
   skills.},

Title = {Do social engagement skills exist and matter beyond personality facet
   traits and vocational interests? A generalization study across six
   countries☆},
Journal = {LEARNING AND INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {115},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Social engagement skills as capacities for active interpersonal
   engagement are thought to conceptually differ from behavioral and
   motivational tendencies and to predict learning and life outcomes. We
   tested these assumptions on the distinct nature and relevance of social
   engagement skills. Quota-representative self-reports from 6987 adults in
   six countries showed strong relations of social engagement skills with
   personality facets and weaker with vocational interests. Partially
   supporting their distinctiveness, social engagement skills were not
   fully reducible to those correlates. Skills predicted self-reported
   learning, quality-of-life, and job outcomes, but offered little
   incremental validity beyond personality and interests. Results largely
   generalized across countries. Yet, the complex interplay between social
   engagement skills, individual differences, and outcomes demonstrated
   crosscountry variations, suggesting sensitivity to sociocontextual
   factors. We conclude that while social engagement skills conceptually
   differ from personality and interests and in themselves predict life
   success, they add limited empirical value beyond these constructs, at
   least for self-reports. Educational relevance statement: Social
   engagement skills are the capacities to actively engage with others. It
   is thought that these capacities differ from other person
   characteristics (e.g., behavioral or motivational tendencies), and that
   this distinction matters for explaining life success. Our study showed
   that while self-reported social engagement skills shared similarities
   with other person characteristics, they still had unique aspects.
   Moreover, social engagement skills mattered, such that more skilled
   adults reported higher quality-of-life, but not necessarily better
   learning. However, social engagement skills did not provide much extra
   insight into life success beyond what was already known from other
   person characteristics. Other than the remaining results, these complex
   relations between social engagement skills, person characteristics, and
   life success largely varied across countries. The results highlight the
   importance of assessing social skills in a situation-specific manner,
   which will be imperative for targeted educational practices in the
   future. Moreover, our study focused on adults, limiting applicability to
   youth, but results suggest that intervention efforts targeting social
   engagement skills may probably yield more interpersonal than academic
   benefits. Finally, when designing or adapting complex educational
   programs, practitioners should consider sociocontextual factors.},

Month = {JUL 25},
Abstract = {The current study sought to extend Soto et al. (2022)'s results on
   social, emotional, and behavioral (SEB) skills to a work setting and
   answer three key questions. First, do SEB skills predict consequential
   work-related outcomes? Second, do SEB skills provide incremental
   validity over the Big Five personality traits in predicting the
   outcomes? Third, is the joint effect of SEB skills and traits additive
   or multiplicative? Results from a sample of real estate agents (N N =
   2,992) in China extend the criterion space of SEB skills by showing
   self-concepts of these skills are related to self-reported work outcomes
   such as citizenship behaviors and job satisfaction in a conceptually
   meaningful way. Further analyses show that these skill-outcome
   relationships remain robust after accounting for effects of traits,
   indicating SEB skills' incremental validity beyond traits in predicting
   outcomes. Finally, comparisons between additive and multiplicative
   models show support for the former because the interaction effects of
   SEB skills and traits provide little meaningful information beyond the
   additive models. Based on these findings, we discuss the implications

Title = {The Relation Between Soft Skills and Arithmetic Performance},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JUN 4},
Abstract = {Arithmetic achievement holds particular significance in contemporary
   times; however, students continue to encounter difficulties in this
   domain. Researchers and organizations are actively seeking factors that
   can support students in navigating mathematical content. To address this
   gap, we propose an examination of the role played by six soft skills
   (adaptability, curiosity, initiative, leadership, perseverance, and
   social awareness), alongside self-regulated learning strategies,
   academic motivation, achievement emotions, and fluid reasoning
   abilities, in students' performance on standardized arithmetic tasks.
   Data were gathered from 551 Italian students aged 11-18 through
   classroom-based paper-and-pencil tasks and questionnaires. Path analysis
   results reveal that only fluid reasoning abilities, academic motivation,
   and negative achievement emotions significantly correlate with
   arithmetic performance. Soft skills demonstrate an indirect relationship
   with arithmetic performance, mediated by negative achievement emotions
   and academic motivation (while not mediated by positive achievement
   emotions and self-regulated learning strategies). These findings
   underscore the increasingly recognized significance of soft skills and
   expand their relevance to arithmetic achievement, potentially suggesting
   novel psychoeducational interventions to bolster students' performance
   in this realm.},

Title = {Nursing students' personality (Temperament and Character), burnout
   symptoms, and health and well-being},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NURSING STUDIES ADVANCES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Background: About 9 million nurses will be needed by 2030. To face these
   unprecedented times, governments/institutions focus on educating as many
   nursing students as possible. This strategy is clouded by burnout and
   lack of both health and well-being among students and by the fact that
   personality is one of the major determinants of these health outcomes.
   Nevertheless, recent findings show that personality is a complex
   adaptive system (i,e., nonlinear) and that combinations of people's
   temperament and character traits (i.e., joint personality networks)
   might provide further information to understand its development,
   academic burnout, and lack of health and well-being. Aims: Our aims were
   to investigate the linear relationship between nursing students'
   personality, burnout, health, and well-being; investigate the linear
   mediational effects of personality and burnout on health and well-being;
   and investigate differences in these health outcomes between/ within
   students with distinct joint personality networks (i.e., nonlinear
   relationships). Method: Swedish nursing students (189 women, 29 men)
   responded to the Temperament and Character Inventory, The Maslach
   Burnout Inventory-General Survey for Students, and the Public Health
   Surveillance Well-Being Scale. We conducted correlation analyses and
   Structural Equation Modeling and, for the nonlinear relationships,
   Latent Profile Analysis and Latent Class Analysis for clustering and
   then Analyses of Variance for differences in health outcomes
   between/within students with distinct personality networks. This study
   was not pre-registered. Results: High levels of health and well-being
   and low burnout symptoms (low Emotional Exhaustion, low Cynicism, and
   high Academic Efficacy) were associated with low Harm Avoidance and high
   Self-Directedness. Some personality traits were associated with specific
   health outcomes (e.g., high Self-Transcendence-high Emotional Exhaustion
   and high Persistence-high Academic Efficacy) and their effects on health
   and well-being were mediated by specific burnout symptoms. Cynicism and
   Emotional Exhaustion predicted low levels of health and well-being,
   Academic Efficacy predicted high levels, and Cynicism lead both directly
   and indirectly to low levels of health and well-being through Emotional
   Exhaustion. We found two joint personality networks: students with an
   Organized/Reliable combination who reported being less emotionally
   exhausted by their studies, less cynical towards education, higher
   self-efficacy regarding their academic work/skills, and better health
   and well-being compared to nursing students with an Emotional/Unreliable
   combination. Conclusions: The coherence of temperament-character, rather
   than single traits, seems to determine students' health outcomes. Thus,
   nursing education might need to focus on helping students to develop
   professional skills and health-related abilities (e.g., self-acceptance
   and spiritualacceptance), by supporting self-awareness.},

Journal = {CHILD ABUSE \& NEGLECT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {152},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Background: Evidence consistently demonstrated that bullying
   victimization was associated with problematic behaviors among
   adolescents. However, scant attention has been given to simultaneous
   comparisons of the impacts of two distinct forms of victimization,
   traditional bullying victimization and cyberbullying victimization. In
   addition, the mechanisms underlying the relationship between bullying
   victimization and problem behavior remain inadequately explored.
   Objective: This study aimed to examine the correlation between bullying
   victimization and problematic behaviors, as well as the mediating roles
   of intrapersonal emotional competence and interpersonal social
   competence. Participants and setting: A sample of 26,450 adolescents
   with a mean age of 15.44 (SD = 0.56) across nine countries was derived
   from the Study on Social and Emotional Skills (SSES). Methods: Data
   analysis was conducted using structural equation modeling, c omprising
   three key components: the measurement model, the structural model, and
   the bootstrapping analysis for mediating effects. Results: Both
   traditional bullying and cyberbullying victimization exhibited positive
   correlations with problematic behaviors, with cyberbullying
   victimization demonstrating a stronger effect. The mediating effects of
   intrapersonal emotional competence and interpersonal social competence
   were observed in the correlation between bullying victimization and
   problematic behaviors. Conclusions: This study not only contributed to
   our comprehension of the underlying mechanisms connecting bullying
   victimization and adolescent problematic behaviors, but also holds
   significance for policy development and practice.},

   the SEL items of the SSIS SELb+MHS available in other languages, a
   German translation has never been completed and validated, despite the
   growing need for SEL and mental health assessment in German-speaking
   countries. To address this need, this study's primary purpose was the
   examination of a German translation of the assessment with a specific
   focus on measurement invariance and concurrent validity invariance
   testing with 821 3rd through 6th -grade students in Austria and Germany.
   Results indicated that the SELb+MHS items clustered into 2 SEL factors
   and 2 EBC factors. With regard to measurement invariance, the SELb+MHS
   functioned similarly across both Austria and Germany and full scalar
   invariance was achieved. Additionally, the overall pattern of concurrent

   satisfaction in relation to academic engagement and social-emotional
   skills. Among a sample of 501 secondary school students (and their
   parents/carers), several need satisfaction variables were examined:
   perceived social-emotional autonomy, perceived social competence,
   perceived emotional competence, perceived relatedness with students, and
   perceived relatedness with teachers. The hypothesised outcomes were
   student-reported behavioural disaffection, and parent reports of
   students' homework practices, expressive skill, and perspective-taking
   skill. Results demonstrated that perceived social competence was
   associated with lower behavioural disaffection. Perceived emotional
   competence was associated with more positive homework practices, greater
   expressive skill, and greater perspective-taking skill. Perceived
   relatedness with teachers was associated with lower behavioural
   disaffection and more positive homework practices. Findings have
   implications for supporting students' positive adjustment in school and
   beyond.},

Abstract = {Background: Socio-emotional skills are critical to life outcomes such as
   achievement, well-being and job success. However, existing research has
   mostly focused on the consequences of socio-emotional skills, with less
   attention devoted to the role of school climate in the deployment of
   these skills. Aims: This study investigated the role of school climate
   in socio-emotional skills. More specifically, we investigated whether
   cooperative or competitive school climates are associated with students'
   socio-emotional skills. Sample: Our study utilized data from the OECD
   Survey on Social and Emotional Skills, collected from 10 cities across
   nine countries. Participants were 60,985 students, including 31,187
   10-year-olds (49.70\% females) and 29,798 15-year-olds (51.6\% females).
   Methods: We conducted multilevel structural equation modelling to test
   whether cooperative and competitive climates were associated with
   socio-emotional skills. These skills include five broad domain skills
   and 15 more specific skills: task performance (self-control,
   responsibility and persistence), emotion regulation (stress resistance,
   emotional control and optimism), collaboration (empathy, trust and
   cooperation), open-mindedness (tolerance, curiosity and creativity) and
   engaging with others (sociability, assertiveness and energy). Results:
   Our findings indicated a positive relationship between a cooperative
   climate and socio-emotional skills. In contrast, the relationship
   between a competitive climate and socio-emotional skills was primarily
   negative. Conclusion: This study highlights the contrasting roles of
   cooperative and competitive climates in students' socio-emotional
   skills.},

Abstract = {Despite cross-sectional evidence of significant associations between
   loneliness and the Big Five personality traits, elucidating the
   directionality of these associations requires further longitudinal
   investigation. To address this gap, the present study examined the
   longitudinal relationship between loneliness and personality traits,
   controlling for negative affect. Data were drawn from the Health and
   Retirement Study collected in 2012, 2016, and 2020 (N = 9671). The
   random intercept cross-lagged panel model was used, enabling the
   examination of withinperson associations. Results showed that loneliness
   predicted subsequent declines in extraversion, agreeableness, and
   conscientiousness. Furthermore, neuroticism was found to be a positive
   predictor of future loneliness, whereas the other personality traits
   were negative predictors. In addition, negative affect had bidirectional
   associations with neuroticism and predicted future loneliness. Overall,
   these results show that these variables are unidirectionally or
   bidirectionally linked at the within-person level. These findings also
   highlight the need for multifaceted interventions that include a range
   of approaches, such as promoting positive personality traits, managing
   negative affect, and enhancing social skills.},

Volume = {36},

Abstract = {Mindreading ability-also referred to as cognitive empathy or
   mentalizing-is typically conceptualized as a relatively stable dimension
   of individual differences in the ability to make accurate inferences
   about the mental states of others. This construct is primarily assessed
   using self-report questionnaires and task-based performance measures.
   However, the validity of these measures has been questioned: According
   to rival interpretations, mindreading tasks may capture general
   cognitive ability, whereas mindreading self-reports may capture
   perceived rather than actual mindreading ability. In this preregistered
   multimethod study involving 700 participants from the U.S. general
   population, we tested the validity of mindreading measures by examining
   the nomological network of self-reports and task-based methods using
   structural equation modeling. Specifically, we contrasted the empirical
   associations with theoretical predictions that assume mindreading
   measures are valid versus invalid. More consistent with rival
   interpretations, mindreading tasks showed a negligible latent
   correlation with mindreading self-reports (.05) and a large one with
   general cognitive ability (.85), whereas mindreading self-reports were
   specifically associated with perceived performance in mindreading tasks
   (.29). Also more consistent with rival interpretations, neither
   mindreading self-reports nor task-based measures showed positive unique
   associations with psychosocial functioning when controlling for general
   cognitive ability and general positive self-evaluation. Instead,
   negative unique associations emerged for both methods, although this
   effect was not robust for tasks. Overall, the results cast doubt on the
   validity of commonly used mindreading measures and support their rival
   interpretations.},

Volume = {150},
Number = {3},
Pages = {253-283},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Theories have proposed diverse reasons for why individual differences
   such as personality traits lead to social status attainment in
   face-to-face groups. We integrated these different theoretical
   standpoints into a model with four paths from individual differences to
   status: a dominance, a competence, a virtue, and a micropolitics path.
   To investigate these paths, we meta-analyzed over 100 years of research
   on bivariate associations of personality traits, cognitive abilities,
   and physical size with the attainment of status-related outcomes in
   face-to-face groups (1,064 effects from 276 samples including 56,153
   participants). The status-related outcome variables were admiring
   respect, social influence, popularity (i.e., being liked by others),
   leadership emergence, and a mixture of outcome variables. The
   meta-analytic correlations we found were largely in line with the
   micropolitics path, tentatively in line with the competence and virtue
   paths, and only partly in line with the dominance path. These findings
   suggest that status attainment depends not only on the competence and
   virtue of an individual but also on how individuals can enhance their
   apparent competence or virtue by behaving assertively, by being
   extraverted, or through self-monitoring. We also investigated how the
   relations between individual differences and status-related outcomes
   were moderated by kind of status-related outcome, nature of the group
   task, culture (collectivism/individualism), and length of acquaintance.
   The moderation analysis yielded mixed and inconclusive results. The
   review ends with directions for research, such as the need to separately
   assess and study the different status-related outcomes. Public
   Significance Statement This meta-analysis investigated who attains
   social status in face-to-face groups. Social status was frequently
   attained not only by competent and virtuous individuals but also by
   individuals who enhanced their appearance of competence or virtue by
   behaving in assertive, extraverted, and socially appropriate ways. These
   findings underline the need to not take competence or virtue of those
   high in social status for granted and to implement evidence-based
   selection procedures when it comes to deciding whom to put into
   superordinate social positions.},

Abstract = {Social, emotional, and behavioral (SEB) skills encompass a broad range
   of interpersonal and intrapersonal abilities that are crucial for
   establishing and maintaining relationships, managing emotions, setting
   and pursuing goals, and exploring new learning opportunities. To address
   the lack of consensus regarding terminology, definition, and assessment
   of SEB skills, Soto et al. developed the Behavioral, Emotional, and
   Social Skills Inventory (BESSI), which consists of 192 items, 32 facets,
   and 5 domains. The objective of the current study was to adapt the BESSI
   to Spanish (referred to as BESSI-Sp) and enhance the overall
   understanding of the BESSI framework. A sample of 303 people was
   employed with a mean age of 30.35 years (SD = 14.73), ranging from 18 to
   85 years. The results indicate that the BESSI-Sp demonstrates strong
   psychometric properties. Its facet- and domain-level structure aligns
   with the theoretical expectations and closely resembles the
   English-language source version. The facets exhibit high reliability
   (mean omega = .89), and the scores demonstrate adequate stability after
   3 to 4 weeks (mean rICC = .77). The BESSI-Sp also displays evidence of
   convergent validity and integrates well with the Big Five framework,
   providing incremental validity for various outcomes. We discuss the
   implications of these findings for the assessment of SEB skills and
   future research in this field.},

Abstract = {BackgroundPhysical activity and modes of sport are widely adopted to
   promote health, wellbeing, behavioural outcomes and educational
   attainment in young people excluded from education. However, little is
   known about the physical activity or sports involvement of excluded
   young people or the role of participation on predictors and outcomes
   associated with exclusion.AimsThe study aimed to understand (i) how
   active excluded young people are, (ii) whether predictors of school
   exclusion are influenced by participation in physical activity or sport
   and (iii) if physical activity or sports participation moderates the
   relationship between school exclusion and health, behavioural and
   educational outcomes.MethodsMillennium Cohort Study Wave 6 data were
   analysed using linear multiple regression models. Participants were
   11,066 young people. Dependent variables were physical activity or
   sports participation. Independent variables included school exclusion,
   body composition and physical health, cognitive and educational
   outcomes, crime, anti-social and harmful behaviours, mental health and
   individual demographic predictors.ResultsMultiple regression analysis of
   Millennium Cohort Study Wave 6 data indicates young people excluded from
   education participate in more (+20.71 +/- 9.72, p = .03) minutes of

Abstract = {Sometimes we regulate our emotions, and other times we need to regulate

   emotion regulation ability by measuring their own emotional experiences
   in a self-oriented emotion regulation task. We assessed regulators'
   other-oriented emotion regulation ability by measuring the emotional
   experiences of their targets in an other-oriented emotion regulation
   task. We found that self-oriented and other-oriented emotion regulation
   abilities were not significantly related. However, people were better
   able to regulate targets who were better at regulating themselves.
   People who frequently used self-oriented emotion regulation strategies
   (e.g., distraction) had greater self-oriented, but not other-oriented,
   emotion regulation ability. People with greater self-oriented emotion
   regulation ability made themselves feel less unpleasant emotions upon
   regulating their emotions. People with greater other-oriented emotion
   regulation ability made both the target of regulation and themselves
   feel less unpleasant emotions upon regulating the target's emotions. The
   target and regulator also felt closer to one another when the regulator
   had greater other-oriented emotion regulation ability. These findings
   suggest that the ability to regulate the emotions of others might be
   linked to desirable personal and social outcomes, even in interactions

Abstract = {Social skills (e.g., assertiveness, empathy, ability to accept
   criticism) are essential for the medical profession and therefore also
   for the selection and development of medical students. However, the term
   ``social skills{''} is understood differently in different contexts.
   There is no agreed upon taxonomy for classifying physicians' social
   skills, and skills with the same meaning often have different names.
   This conceptual ambiguity presents a hurdle to cross-context
   communication and to the development of methods to assess social skills.
   Drawing from behavioral psychology, we aim to contribute to a better
   understanding of social skills in the medical context. To this end, we
   introduce a theoretically and empirically informed taxonomy that can be
   used to integrate the large number of different social skills. We
   consider how skills manifest at the behavioral level to ensure that we
   focus only on skills that are actually observable, distinguishable, and
   measurable. Here, behavioral research has shown that three overarching
   skill dimensions can be seen in interpersonal situations and are clearly
   distinguishable from each other: agency skill (i.e., getting ahead in
   social situations), communion skill (i.e., getting along in social
   situations), and interpersonal resilience (i.e., staying calm in social
   situations). We show that almost all social skills relevant for
   physicians fit into this structure. The approach presented allows
   redundant descriptions to be combined under three clearly
   distinguishable and behavior based dimensions of social skills. This
   approach has implications for the assessment of social skills in both
   the selection and development of students.},

Abstract = {The Alternative Model of Personality Disorders (AMPD) is a dimensional,
   empirically based diagnostic system developed to overcome the serious
   limitations of traditional categories. We review themounting evidence on
   its convergent and discriminant validity, with an incursion into the
   less-studied ICD-11 system. In the literature, the AMPD's Pathological
   Trait Model (Criterion B) shows excellent convergence with normal
   personality traits, and it could be useful as an organizing framework
   for mental disorders. In contrast, Personality Functioning (Criterion A)
   cannot be distinguished from personality traits, lacks both discriminant
   and incremental validity, and has a shaky theoretical background. We
   offer some suggestions with a view to the future. These include removing
   Criterion A, using the real-life consequences of traits as indicators of
   severity, delving into the dynamic mechanisms underlying traits, and
   furthering the integration of currently disengaged psychological
   paradigms that can shape a sounder clinical science.},

Pages = {503-526},
Abstract = {The teaching profession is characterised by high levels of stress and
   numerous emotional challenges, especially in the early stages of a
   career. Previous research suggests that teachers' social and emotional
   competencies (SEC) are related to their occupational well-being as they
   influence the way they cope with everyday emotional challenges at work.
   This points to the role of SEC as potential psychological resources that
   can mitigate negative outcomes such as burnout and leaving the
   profession among teachers in the early stages of their career. However,
   research in this area is still scarce and it is unclear how certain SEC
   are related to different aspects of occupational well-being and
   commitment to the teaching profession. The aim of this paper is to
   review conceptual frameworks of SEC and existing research in the field,
   discuss the role they play in education and compare them with related
   constructs in the domain of individual differences. Furthermore, it will
   provide an overview of research on teachers' occupational well-being and
   examine the relevance of teachers' SEC for outcomes such as burnout,
   work engagement, and job satisfaction. The paper will conclude by
   examining methodological aspects of SEC assessment and review challenges
   and directions for future research.},

   considering types, magnitude, and breadth. Finally, we provide
   additional considerations and future directions, including expanding the
   outcome domain, overcoming the limitations of past gifted and talented
   research studies, and suggesting possibilities for future research. Our

Journal = {LEARNING AND INSTRUCTION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {90},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Background: The salience of perceived academic competence has been long
   understood in educational research. Research is now revealing the
   salience of perceived social-emotional competence (perceived-SEC; i.e.,
   the sense of being capable in one's social-emotional interactions).
   However, more research is needed to extend understanding of factors
   associated with perceived-SEC. Aims: Guided by the Social and Emotional
   Competence School Model, we investigated students' perceived-SEC. We
   examined the extent to which students' perceptions of
   autonomy-supportive teaching are linked with perceived-SEC and, in turn,
   students' well-being (student-reported positive and negative affect),
   social-emotional skills (parent-reported cognitive reappraisal and
   self-reflection), and behavioral outcomes (parent-reported prosocial
   behavior and conduct problems). Sample: The sample comprised 501
   Australian students (and their parents/carers). Methods: Using bifactor
   exploratory structural equation modelling, five dimensions of
   perceived-SEC (for assertiveness, tolerance, social regulation, emotion
   regulation, and emotional awareness) were examined via a global factor
   and as specific factors. Then, structural equation modelling was used to
   examine associations among all variables. Results: Perceived
   autonomy-support was associated with global perceived-SEC. In turn,
   global perceived-SEC was associated with all outcomes. Three specific
   perceived-SEC factors also had unique associations with outcomes (beyond
   the role of the global factor): perceived competence for tolerance
   (linked with the two behaviors), emotional regulation (linked with
   negative affect and the two social-emotional skills), and emotional
   awareness (linked with self-reflection). Conclusions: Findings yield
   knowledge about perceived-SEC and hold implications for understanding
   and supporting students' well-being, social-emotional skills, and
   behavioral outcomes.},

   satisfaction, emotional exhaustion, turnover intentions, self-efficacy).
   Data from 1137 secondary school teachers was collected at two time
   points. To decompose the variance in personality items into unique
   domain and facets parts while simultaneously controlling for the
   response style method factor and the measurement error, the
   domain-incremental facet-acquiescence bifactor (DIFAB) model was tested.
   The results showed that incremental facets explained variance in
   analyzed job-related outcomes beyond the domains, but the amount of the
   explained variance differed across the criteria.},

Abstract = {Meta-analytic evidence shows that most personality traits tend to
   increase through early adulthood and middle age but decrease in late

   Specifically, decreases in Extraversion, Agreeableness,

   capacity to control one's environment, whereas continued increases in
   Emotional Stability reflect increases in individual's ability to
   compensate and cope with age-graded losses. Pairing motivational

Abstract = {Passion is stereotypically expressed through animated facial

   extraverts expressed their passion more strongly through these
   stereotypical expressions of passion, and observers perceived extraverts
   as more passionate than introverts. Across three studies (Ntotal =

   expressions and behaviors scale (PEBS). Using this measure in a daily
   diary study (N = 206, k = 1,862), we found that extraverts not only
   expressed their passion in more stereotypical ways, but through a
   broader variety of expressions in general. Extraverts are perceived as
   more passionate because they have a broader behavioral repertoire,
   express their passion more frequently and diversely, and thereby attain

Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Introduction. Social and emotional (SE) skills are known to be linked to
   important life outcomes, many of which fall into the academic domain.
   For example, meta-analytic data show that the skill of Sustaining Effort
   is nearly or just as important for academic performance as intelligence.
   In a recent study with long-term tracking of high school students, those
   who came from schools with a strong emphasis on SE skill development
   were more likely to enroll in college within two years of high school
   graduation. Longitudinal studies like this one are rare, however.
   Method. The focus of the present study is on the SE skills of 6662
   students assessed during high school and their relationship with high
   school academic performance, standardized college admissions test
   performance, and ultimately postsecondary enrollment and retention.
   Results. We examined mean-level differences in household income, high
   school GPA, ACT Composite scores, and SE skills by college enrollment
   and retention status and found several significant differences, often
   favoring the enrolled or retained group. Moreover, we found support for
   the incremental validity of SE skills as they predicted enrollment and
   retention above household income, high school GPA, and ACT scores.

   Using a network psychometrics method called Exploratory Graph Analysis,
   we uncovered and compared the underlying structure of the

Abstract = {Academic Abstract
   This paper aims to motivate research on emotion regulation success in
   naturalistic settings. We define emotion regulation success as achieving
   one's emotion regulation goal and differentiate it from related concepts
   (i.e., maladaptive regulation and dysregulation). As goals vary across
   individuals and situations, it is insufficient to conceptualize emotion
   regulation success as maximizing positive affect and minimizing negative
   affect. Instead, emotion regulation success can be measured through
   novel approaches targeting the achievement of emotion regulation goals.
   In addition to utilizing novel data analytic tools (e.g., response
   surface analyses), future research can make use of informant reports and
   observing ambulatory behavior or physiology. Considering emotion
   regulation goals when measuring daily emotion regulation success has the
   potential to answer key questions about personality, development, and
   mental health.
   Public Abstract
   People differ in how they want to feel in daily situations (e.g.,
   excited) and why they want to feel that way (e.g., to make others feel
   better), depending on factors such as culture or age. Although people
   manage their emotions to reach these goals, most research assessing
   emotion regulation success has not taken individual goals into account.
   When assessing if people successfully regulate their emotions, most
   research in daily life has been focused on whether people feel more
   positive or less negative. To help study emotion regulation success in a
   more thoughtful and inclusive way, we propose a new approach to
   conceptualizing emotion regulation success that incorporates individual
   differences in what motivates people to regulate and discuss future
   research directions and applications.},

Title = {How Personality Matters for Education Research},
Journal = {EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {35},
Number = {3},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The field of personality psychology could contribute to the aims of
   educational research, but several misconceptions may hold back this
   synthesis. We address three ``misconceptions{''} about personality
   psychology that are surprisingly pervasive outside of that field: that
   there are personality types, that personality is fixed, and that the
   existence of personality implies that situations are unimportant. We
   then cover four ways that personality psychology can assist educational
   aims: personality can be used to (1) boost our ability to accurately
   predict educational outcomes, (2) inform educational interventions, (3)
   support the academic development of all learners in personalised
   learning interventions, and (4) be employed as target outcomes for
   education. In the process, we show how personality relates to important
   educational outcomes, outline theoretical links with educationally
   relevant concepts like socio-emotional skills, and include an overview
   of current personality scales that can be used when getting started.
   Through this paper, we hope to stimulate and enthuse researchers to
   advance synthesis between the disciplines.},

Title = {Teacher personality domains and facets: Their unique associations with
   student-ratings of teaching quality and teacher enthusiasm},
Journal = {LEARNING AND INSTRUCTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {88},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Background: Previous research on the relationship between teacher
   personality and teaching performance yielded mixed results and typically
   considered only the broad personality domains while neglecting the
   narrower personality facets that constitute the domains.Aim: The aim of
   this study was to examine the incremental value of teacher Big Five
   personality facets in explaining student-ratings of teaching quality and
   teacher enthusiasm.Samples: In total, 1067 teachers and 18,814 of their
   students from 73 secondary schools in Croatia participated in the study.
   Method: Teachers self-reported their personality whereas students rated
   the teaching quality and displayed enthusiasm of their teachers. Each
   teacher was rated by one class of students.Results: The bifactor-(S-1)
   multilevel structural equation models for each Big Five personality
   domain showed that both the general reference factor and the specific
   factors explained the variance in student-ratings of teaching quality
   and teacher enthusiasm.Conclusions: A more fine-grained approach to
   examining the effects of teacher personality at different levels of
   hierarchy might be helpful for identifying specific parts of teacher
   personality with the greatest explanatory power in predicting teaching
   performance.},

Abstract = {School achievement has long-term consequences for occupational success,
   mental health, and overall psychological adjustment. The present study
   examined the association between temperament trajectories from late
   childhood through adolescence and academic outcomes during late
   adolescence and young adulthood. Data come from the California Families
   Project, a longitudinal study of 674 Mexican-origin youth assessed 12
   times from Age 10 to 23, and from school records. Results from latent
   growth curve models indicate that higher levels of Effortful Control
   (EC) at Age 10 were associated with better academic achievement (i.e.,
   higher high school grade point average and test scores, greater
   likelihood of high school graduation and college attendance) in late
   adolescence and young adulthood. Higher levels of Negative Emotionality
   (NEM) at Age 10 were associated with worse academic achievement, but
   this effect did not hold for all facets of NEM. Neither the levels nor
   slopes of Positive Emotionality (Surgency, Affiliation) consistently
   predicted school achievement. There were no main effects of the EC or
   NEM slopes; however, statistically significant interactions between
   these slopes and parental monitoring emerged. When parental monitoring
   was low, youth who experienced greater increases in EC (vs. flat or
   decreasing slopes) had better academic achievement, and youth who
   experienced greater increases in NEM had worse academic achievement; in
   contrast, when parents closely monitored their children, changes in EC
   and NEM were only weakly associated with achievement. Overall, these
   findings demonstrate that temperament in late childhood, and changes in
   temperament across adolescence, have important prospective effects on
   academic achievement.},

Abstract = {The study explored the impacts of patterns of language use (PLU) and
   socio-economic status (SES) on Casper, a constructed-response
   situational judgment test (SJT). 10,266 applicants from two U.S. medical
   schools were grouped into self-reported balanced bilinguals, unbalanced
   bilinguals, English monolinguals, and English as a Second Language (ESL)
   students. A multicomponent SES composite was used to assess the degree
   of socioeconomic disadvantage (DSD). Results from a hierarchical
   regression analysis showed that after accounting for demographic
   variables, both PLU and DED were significant factors on applicants'
   Casper performance. Bilingualism was associated with better Casper
   performance compared to English monolinguals and ESL students. No
   significant effect of speaking English as a native language was found on
   applicants' Casper performance. English monolinguals and ESL students
   performed equivalently on Casper. Finally, high DSD was associated with
   better Casper performance than low DSD, and the impact of DSD on Casper
   held the same across all four language groups. These findings provide
   evidence that socio-cultural factors, such as PLU and DSD have important
   impacts on SJT performance. Further research is needed to understand the
   role of differences in language construction across socio-cultural
   factors on constructed-response SJT performance.},

Journal = {EARLY CHILDHOOD RESEARCH QUARTERLY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {65},
Pages = {261-274},
Abstract = {Mechanisms translating initial impacts of early childhood education
   (ECE) programs into longer-term effects are poorly understood. This
   article posits that the temporality of unobserved mediated effects are
   integral to our understanding of the pathways underlying ECE programs'
   long-term impacts. Leveraging panel data, we examined the patterns of
   indirect effects from two ECE programs on educational attainment via
   bundled mediators measured at age 8 or 10, 12, and 15 (the Abecedarian
   Project: N =107; 97\% Black; 3\% White; 52\% girls. Head Start: N =
   1,251; 44\% Black; 25\% Hispanic; 31\% White; 50\% girls). Accounting
   for up to 50\% of the impact, indirect effects in both studies revealed
   stable patterns of direct effects, suggesting that impacts on unmeasured
   mediators were present throughout the duration of the period after the
   end of ECE programs and before later outcomes were observed. These
   findings indicate that some of the mechanisms involved in Abecedarian's
   and Head Start's long-term impacts were substantial and independent from
   those typically captured by commonly used measures of cognitive and
   socioemotional or behavioral skills, which points to the need for new
   approaches to studying child-environment transactions.},

   12 to 19 Years Old},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Individuals use social, emotional, and behavioral (SEB) skills to build
   and maintain social relationships, regulate emotions, and manage
   goal-directed behaviors. A promising integrative framework of SEB skills
   was recently proposed, showing that they matter for positive outcomes
   during adolescence. Nothing is known about how and whether they differ
   between 12 and 19 years old and whether such differences depend on
   gender (males or females). Uncovering their age trajectories is
   fundamental because SEB skills are highly needed during this period of
   life. Educators, psychologists, and policymakers need to understand
   when, why, and how interventions concerning SEB skills should be
   proposed, potentially considering male and female profiles. To cover
   this gap, we cross-sectionally analyzed data from 4106 participants
   (2215 females, 12-19 years old). We highlighted age and gender
   differences in the five domains of SEB skills (self-management,
   innovation, cooperation, social engagement, and emotional resilience).
   Our results show that each SEB skill follows a specific age trend:
   emotional resilience and cooperation skills increase naturally between
   12 and 19 years old, while innovation, social engagement, and
   self-management skills decline, especially between 12 and 16 years old,
   and grow later. The trajectories of self-management, social engagement,
   and emotional resilience skills also differ between males and females.
   Importantly, we detected declines in SEB skills (especially for social
   engagement and innovation skills) that can inform policies and
   interventions to sustain SEB skills in youths to favor their well-being
   and success in this crucial period.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The distinction between hard and soft skills has long been a topic of
   debate in the field of psychology, with hard skills referring to
   technical or practical abilities, and soft skills relating to
   interpersonal capabilities. This paper explores the generic composition
   of any skill, proposing a unified framework that consists of five
   distinct components: knowledge, active cognition, conation, affection,
   and sensory-motor abilities. Building upon previous research and
   theories, such as Hilgard's ``Trilogy of Mind{''}, the generic skill
   components approach aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the
   structure and composition of any skill, whether hard or soft. By
   examining these components and their interactions, we can gain a more
   in-depth understanding of the nature of skills and their development.
   This approach has several potential applications and implications for
   various fields, including education, training, and workplace
   productivity. Further research is needed to refine and expand upon the
   generic skill components theory, exploring the interactions between the
   different components, as well as the impact of contextual factors on

Abstract = {Assessing psychological indicators such as positive behavioral skills in
   the context of adolescent personality development during the pandemic

   adolescents who participate in sports has recently become an undeniable
   scientific issue. This study aimed to analyze positive behavioral skills
   in the cadet (U16) and junior (U18) age groups of young basketball
   players during the COVID-19 pandemic. The participants were 378 male
   athletes (age 16.36 \& PLUSMN; 1.15 years). Results revealed that U18
   athletes are more capable of taking responsibility, positively
   evaluating themselves, behaving pro-socially with teammates,
   cooperating, demonstrating assertiveness, demonstrating self-control,
   and managing emotions than U16 adolescent athletes. When comparing the
   effect sizes in the current study during the pandemic with similar
   studies by other authors, the pandemic may have had a larger negative
   effect on some positive behavioral skills (ability to control emotions,
   social responsibility skills, cooperation skills) in U16 athletes than
   in U18 athletes, as the effect sizes were small before the pandemic and
   moderate during the pandemic in the current study. This study's results

Abstract = {Objective: Personality changes across the life span. Life events, such
   as marriage, becoming a parent, and retirement, have been proposed as
   facilitating personality growth via the adoption of novel social roles.
   However, empirical evidence linking life events with personality
   development is sparse. Most studies have relied on few assessments
   separated by long time intervals and have focused on a single life
   event. In contrast, the content of life is composed of small, recurrent
   experiences (e.g., getting sick or practicing a hobby), with relatively
   few major events (e.g., childbirth). Small, frequently experienced life
   events may play an important and overlooked role in personality
   development.Method: The present study examined the extent to which 25
   major and minor life events alter the trajectory of personality
   development in a large, frequently assessed sample (N-sample = 4904,
   N-assessments = 47,814, median retest interval = 35 days).Results: Using
   a flexible analytic strategy to accommodate the repeated occurrence of
   life events, we found that the trajectory of personality development
   shifted in response to a single occurrence of some major life events
   (e.g., divorce), and recurrent, ``minor{''} life experiences (e.g.,
   one's partner doing something special).Conclusion: Both stark role
   changes and frequently reinforced minor experiences can lead to
   personality change.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS AND PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {39},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-18},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {There is a wealth of evidence justifying the use of personality
   assessments for selection. Nonetheless, some reluctance to use these
   assessments stems from their perceived vulnerability to response
   distortion (i.e., faking) and the somewhat negative applicant reactions
   they elicit, when compared to other assessments. Adopting a
   forced-choice personality assessment format appears to alleviate the
   former problem but exacerbates the latter. In this study, we introduce
   basic psychological needs as a theoretical foundation to develop
   interventions to improve reactions to forced-choice personality
   assessments. We propose that the forced-choice format impedes
   respondents' desire to respond to items in a preferred way, interfering
   with autonomy need satisfaction, and constrains respondents' opportunity
   to show their capabilities, interfering with competence need
   satisfaction. In this pre-registered between-subjects experiment (N =
   1565), we investigated two modifications to a ranked forced-choice
   personality questionnaire and compared these to traditional
   forced-choice and single-stimulus (Likert) formatted questionnaires. One
   modification, where participants could write a free-text response
   following the assessment, did not show significant effects on reactions.
   The second modification allowed participants to view all items they had
   ranked last (first) and then identify any the participant believed in
   fact described them well (poorly). That modification positively affected
   perceived autonomy- and competence-support, and fairness perceptions,
   bridging approximately half of the gap between reactions to
   forced-choice and single-stimulus assessment formats. This study
   suggests that a modification to forced-choice personality questionnaires
   may improve applicant reactions and that basic psychological needs
   theory may be a fruitful lens through which to further understand
   reactions to assessments.},

Abstract = {Globalization, technological advances, economic and geopolitical shocks,
   pandemics, and any number of novel or unanticipated events have one
   thing in common: they represent change and require dynamic responses and
   adaptation from organizations, teams, and individuals. A critical
   resource for individuals to be adaptive are broad skills relevant to
   varied organizational conditions. These adaptive skills have been
   discussed in diverse venues but rarely in the organizational literature.
   Also, most, if not all, of extant conceptual frameworks related to
   adaptive skills remain unvalidated. The purpose of this research was to
   organize these skills, define and situate them in the relevant
   organizational and psychological literatures, and empirically test a
   proposed four-category framework. The experimental results supported the
   C+MAC framework, as skills were better categorized in terms of their
   theoretically related category. Additionally, the four-category
   framework proved a better fit to the skills compared to an influential,
   alternative model. The findings' implications are discussed, noting how
   an empirically validated framework can facilitate understanding of how
   individuals engage with organizational environments and organizations
   get their work done.},

Abstract = {Soft skills are the key characteristics for students' success and
   wellbeing in the 21st century, but they were only rarely studied
   contemporarily or integrated into comprehensive models of self-regulated
   learning. This makes it difficult to understand the role that specific
   skills have above and beyond the others and how they work together to
   favor students' achievement and life satisfaction. For this reason, in a
   sample of 585 students (10-18 years old), we applied an exploratory
   network analysis and studied three crucial soft skills (i.e.,
   adaptability, curiosity, and perseverance) and their contemporary
   network of inter-relationships with a host of functional study-related
   factors, including self-regulated learning strategies, motivation,
   emotions, cognitive abilities, academic achievement, and life and school
   satisfaction. Results show that the three soft skills play a positive
   role within the school context through their association with the
   majority of the study-related factors that mediate their relationships
   with academic achievement. Importantly, the results differentiated
   adaptability (which mainly relates with wellbeing and emotional
   variables), perseverance (which relates with the cognitive and
   behavioral aspect of learning), and curiosity (which bridges the
   connection between the other skills and relates with emotional and
   behavioral variables) in the school context. Overall, these findings
   contribute to the deepening of the theoretical framework on soft skills
   and their role as part of a successful learning profile, and inform us
   about the possible effectiveness of intervention on soft skills for
   students' achievement and wellbeing.},

Abstract = {Business leaders and HR professionals have long recognized the
   importance of social skills for effective organizational functioning,
   particularly in roles requiring high levels of interpersonal
   interaction. Accordingly, organizational science scholars have produced
   a large amount of research that can be organized under the broad heading
   of social skills. Yet, three key issues in the literature are hampering
   progress: (1) the lack of a well-accepted articulation of the social
   skills phenomenon, what it is and what it is not; (2) conceptual
   redundancy and conflation among the set of social skills-related
   concepts (e.g., individual differences, skills, behavior, evaluations,
   etc.), and (3) full consideration of the importance of social behavior
   in understanding social skills. We propose solutions for understanding
   social skills that begin to resolve these issues and help strengthen
   future empirical research. Specifically, we present two distinct, but
   related, conceptualizations of social skills: social skills enactment
   and social skills reputation. We then offer a theoretically grounded
   perspective, the Social Skills Framework, which incorporates these
   conceptualizations of social skills, provides a structure into which
   existing social skills concepts can be integrated and evaluated for
   conceptual clarity, and centers social behavior. After describing the
   framework, we offer a research agenda that focuses on refining the
   framework and investigating key issues related to the two
   conceptualizations of social skills.},

Abstract = {Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a heterogeneous condition that
   is particularly associated with three broad personality dimensions:
   neuroticism (i.e., high negative affectivity), agreeableness (i.e., low
   antagonism), and conscientiousness (i.e., low disinhibition). The
   purpose of the present study was to explore whether treatment with BPD
   Compass, a novel personality-based intervention for BPD, results in
   greater reductions in BPD symptoms, neuroticism, agreeableness, and
   conscientiousness compared to a waitlist control (WLC) condition. We
   also aimed to characterize within-treatment effects for participants
   assigned to the BPD Compass condition and evaluate patients'
   satisfaction with treatment. Participants (N = 51; M-age = 28.38; 83.3\%
   female; 93.8\% White; 54.2\% sexual minority) meeting DSM-5 criteria for
   BPD were enrolled in a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the
   efficacy of BPD Compass. Patients were randomly assigned to receive 18
   sessions of BPD Compass or complete an 18-week waiting period. BPD
   Compass led to larger reductions in BPD symptoms (assessor-rated {[}beta
   = -0.47] and self-reported {[}beta = -0.62]) and neuroticism (beta =
   -0.37), but not agreeableness (beta = 0.08) or conscientiousness (beta =
   0.10), compared to the WLC condition. Within the BPD Compass condition,
   pre- to posttreatment improvements in BPD symptoms, neuroticism, and
   conscientiousness were significant and large in magnitude (Hedges' gs:
   -1.38 to -1.08). Patients were highly satisfied with BPD Compass and
   generally perceived it to be an appropriate length. Thus, BPD Compass
   may be an accessible and useful complement to more specialty or
   intensive treatments for BPD.},

Abstract = {Introduction/objective: Socio-emotional competencies are skills that
   mediate be-tween emotional management and social adjustment. These
   skills are relevant for: learn-ing, professional performance, mental
   health, and well-being. The objective is to analyze the psychometric
   properties of the Social and emotional Competencies Questionnaire SEC-Q
   in Chilean university students. Method: The sample included 699
   university students, 493 women and 206 men. The internal structure was
   analyzed through cross validation, an exploratory and confirmatory
   factorial analysis. Convergent and discriminant validity were determined
   using the Pearson correlation coefficient between the subscales of the
   SEC-Q with the Scale of Perceived Self-Efficacy Specific to Academic
   Situations, Life Satisfaction and Maslach Burnout Inventory. Results:
   adequate psychometric properties in the questionnaire, observing the
   four components proposed by the structure of the original instrument
   -self-awareness, self-man-agement, social awareness and decision-making.
   These competencies showed, as expected, a positive relationship with
   self-efficacy and life satisfaction, and an inverse relationship with
   stress. Also, social awareness presented differences according to
   gender, being higher in wom-en than in men. Conclusion: The SEC-Q is a
   reliable and valid instrument for the evaluation of Chilean university
   students.(c) 2023 Fundacion Universitaria Konrad Lorenz. This is an open

Abstract = {The study of emotional intelligence (EI) in the field of leadership, and
   in the organizational sciences in general, has often been characterized
   by controversy and criticism. But the study of EI has nonetheless
   persisted by developing new measures and models to address these
   concerns. In a prior letter exchange by Antonakis, Ashkanasy, and
   Dasborough (2009), two author teams debated the role of EI in the
   leadership literature, but also set an agenda for research and
   reconciliation for the future. The present exchange revisits these
   arguments using evidence accumulated over the past decade. Specifically,
   the authors debate not only the evidence for the predictive power of EI
   for workplace outcomes, but also the validity of EI as a construct, the
   measurement of EI, and the appropriateness of analytical tests for
   establishing the value of EI. Although the author teams agree on the
   value of the study of emotions and the need for rigorous research in
   this area, they nonetheless propose alternative agendas and priorities
   for the future. Further, they conclude that the issues identified in
   this exchange are not unique to the study of EI; but should also serve
   to inform the study of other personality factors and leadership more
   broadly.},

Abstract = {A focus on implementing social and emotional (SE) learning into
   curricula continues to gain popularity in K-12 educational contexts at
   the policy and practitioner levels. As it continues to be elevated in
   educational discourse, it becomes increasingly clear that it is
   important to have reliable, validated measures of students' SE skills.
   Here we argue that framework and design are additional important
   considerations for the development and selection of SE skill
   assessments. We report the reliability and validity evidence for The
   Mosaic (TM) by ACT (R) Social Emotional Learning Assessment, an
   assessment designed to measure SE skills in middle and high school
   students that makes use of a research-based framework (the Big Five) and
   a multi-method approach (three item types including Likert, forced
   choice, and situational judgment tests). Here, we provide the results
   from data collected from more than 33,000 students who completed the
   assessment and for whom we have data on various outcome measures. We
   examined the validity evidence for the individual item types and the
   aggregate scores based on those three. Our findings support the
   contribution of multi-method assessment and an aggregate score. We
   discuss the ways the field can benefit from this or similarly designed
   assessments and discuss how the assessment results can be used by
   practitioners to promote programs aimed at stimulating students'

Abstract = {Recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) have produced
   general models that can perform complex tasks such as summarizing long
   passages and translating across languages. Here, we introduce a method
   to extract adjective similarities from language models as done with
   survey-based ratings in traditional psycholexical studies but using
   millions of times more text in a natural setting. The correlational
   structure produced through this method is highly similar to that of
   self- and other-ratings of 435 English terms reported by Saucier and
   Goldberg (1996a). The first three unrotated factors produced using NLP
   are congruent with those in survey data, with coefficients of 0.89,
   0.79, and 0.79. This structure is robust to many modeling decisions:
   adjective set, including those with 1,710 (Goldberg. 1982) and 18,000
   English terms (Allport \& Odbert, 1936); the query used to extract
   correlations; and language model. Notably, 4 Neuroticism and Openness
   are only weakly and inconsistently recovered. This is a new source of
   signal that is closer to the original (semantic) vision of the lexical
   hypothesis. The method can be applied where surveys cannot: in dozens of
   languages simultaneously, with tens of thousands of items, on historical
   text, and at extremely large scale for little cost. The code is made
   public to facilitate reproduction and fast iteration in new directions

   major PYD paradigms (i.e., Five/Six/7 Cs model, 15 PYD constructs, and
   the 40 developmental assets framework), we propose an integrative
   paradigm of PYD, which organizes the different indicators of adolescent
   thriving into three clusters: (a) intrapersonal-immediate, (b)
   interpersonal-proximal, and (c) ecological-distal indicators. Building
   on prior empirically supported models of PYD, this paradigm aims to
   provide a common and unifying taxonomy among developmental scientists in
   conceptualizing and measuring adolescent thriving without neglecting the
   specificity of adolescent development in various ecologies. Future
   directions for PYD researchers, practitioners, and policymakers to
   advance the field are discussed.},

Abstract = {Feeling powerful and desiring power, the ``having{''} versus
   ``wanting{''} psychological experiences of power, are often conflated
   within a single measurement dimension (e.g., ascendance, social
   influence, dominance, agentic ex-traversion, assertiveness, social
   boldness). Across six studies, employing multiple modes of assessment,
   we examine the differential associations of tendencies toward feeling
   powerful and desiring power with a range of interpersonal functioning
   variables. Feeling powerful was associated with more harmonious
   interpersonal ten-dencies (e.g., agreeableness, empathy), whereas
   desiring power was associated with less harmonious interper-sonal
   tendencies (e.g., hostility, Machiavellianism). Nomological nets of a
   wide range of extant assessment measures (e.g., facets of extraversion
   and psychopathic personality) may be distorted due to the conflation of
   these two power constructs, with implications for many domains of
   research.},

Abstract = {The present research addresses three key questions about social,

   with the Big Five traits and Collaborative for Academic, Social, and

   relate with consequential outcomes in adolescence? Third, do SEB skills
   provide incremental validity beyond personality traits? Results from a
   diverse sample of high school students (N = 897) indicate that SEB
   skills converge with the Big Five traits and CASEL competencies in
   expected and conceptually meaningful ways. Analyses of self-reported and
   school-reported outcomes extend SEB skills' nomological network by
   showing that they predict academic achievement and engagement,
   occupational interests, social relationships, civic engagement, and
   well-being. Finally, tests of incremental validity indicate that SEB
   skills provide unique information beyond personality traits and that
   this information matters for predicting outcomes during adolescence.
   These findings advance our understanding of the nature, correlates, and

Journal = {JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {3},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Social skills are of key importance in everyday and work life. However,
   the way in which they are typically assessed via self-report
   questionnaires has one potential downside; self-reports assess
   individuals' global self-concepts, which do not necessarily reflect
   individuals' actual social behaviors. In this research, we aimed to
   investigate how self-concepts assessed via questionnaires relate to
   skill expression assessed via behavioral observations after short
   interpersonal simulations. For this, we used an alternative
   behavior-based skill assessment approach designed to capture expressions
   of predefined social skills. Self- and observer ratings were collected
   to assess three different social skills: agency (i.e., getting ahead in
   social situations), communion (i.e., getting along in social
   situations), and interpersonal resilience (i.e., staying calm in social
   situations). We explored how these skills were related to self-concepts
   by differentiating between a classic personality measure (i.e., Big Five
   Inventory 2; BFI-2) and a novel skill questionnaire (i.e., Behavioral,
   Emotional, and Social Skills Inventory; BESSI). The results (N = 137)
   showed that both personality and skill self-concepts predicted
   self-rated skill expression, with the BESSI showing incremental
   validity. For both personality and skills self-concepts, the
   relationships with observer-rated skill expression were significant for
   agency but not for communion or interpersonal resilience. We discuss
   these results and highlight the theoretical and practical importance of
   differentiating between skill self-concepts and actual skill expression.},

Abstract = {Social, emotional, and behavioral (SEB) skills comprise a broad set of
   abilities that are essential for building and maintaining relationships,
   regulating emotions, selecting and pursuing goals, or exploring novel
   stimuli. Toward an improved SEB skill assessment, Soto and colleagues
   recently introduced the Behavioral, Emotional, and Social Skills
   Inventory (BESSI). Measuring 32 facets from 5 domains with 192 items
   (assessment duration: similar to 15 min), BESSI constitutes the most
   extensive SEB inventory to date. However, so far, BESSI exists only in
   English. In three studies, we comprehensively validated a novel
   German-language adaptation, BESSI-G. Moreover, we expanded evidence on
   BESSI in three ways by (1) assessing the psychometric properties of the
   32 individual skill facets, in addition to their domain-level structure;
   (2) providing first insights into the temporal stabilities of the 32
   facets over 1.5 and 8 months; and (3) investigating the domains' and
   facets' associations with intelligence, in addition to personality
   traits. Results show that BESSI-G exhibits good psychometric properties
   (unidimensionality, reliability, factorial validity). Its domain-level
   structure is highly similar to that of the English-language source
   version. The facets show high temporal stabilities, convergent validity
   with personality traits, and discriminant validity with fluid and
   crystallized intelligence. We discuss implications for research on SEB
   skills.},

Title = {Examining interests and goals as predictors of gender differences in

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {111},
Number = {4},
Pages = {852-867},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Background Given the gendering of engineering roles and competencies,
   the evidence that the skills required for engineering management are
   widely referred to as social, and the fact that men engineers are
   stereotyped as more technical, and women as more social, it might be
   theorized that (a) those that occupy managerial (vs. technical) roles in
   engineering are more socially oriented, and (b) that this will
   especially be the case for women. However, no research has empirically
   tested the relationship between having socially oriented characteristics
   and being in managerial roles within the engineering profession, nor
   have gender differences been examined. Purpose We test whether social
   interests and communal goal strivings are linked to engineers'
   positioning in managerial roles and explore gender as a moderator of
   these relationships. Additionally, because enterprising interests and
   agentic goal strivings have been linked to managerial roles in other
   occupations, we test these as additional predictors of engineers'
   positioning in managerial roles. Method In a field survey of 274
   industry engineers from multiple organizations and subfields, we tested
   the relationships described using hierarchical linear regression
   analysis. Results Enterprising interests and agentic goals, but not
   social interests and communal goals, were associated with being in
   managerial roles, and there were no gender differences in these
   relationships. Conclusions Our findings challenge perceptions that
   managerial roles in engineering, and particularly women's positioning in
   these roles, are associated with socially oriented tendencies. Findings
   have implications for research on gender stereotyping and
   intraoccupational gender segregation in engineering and hold educational
   implications for curriculum, instruction, and advising.},

Abstract = {In their target article, Morey et al. (2022) provided a comprehensive
   overview of research on Criterion A of the alternative DSM-5 model for
   personality disorders over the past 10 years. Although this overview is
   undoubtedly informative and helpful, it offers little guidance on both
   certain weaknesses of Criterion A and research gaps and needs. A
   structural reason for this could be that the scientific field is divided
   into 2 camps with respect to Criterion A: Some authors focus mainly on
   confirmatory results and want to defend Criterion A in its current form,
   whereas others take the same results as an opportunity to call for its
   abolition. In this situation, there is little room for a nuanced and
   constructive discussion of the empirical and conceptual strengths and
   weaknesses of Criterion A. In this commentary, I use 2 examples to
   illustrate what research aimed at revising Criterion A might look like.
   From an empirical point of view, studies that take into account the
   peculiarities of the latent structure of the Level of Personality
   Functioning Scale are important because they can reveal local
   misspecification and challenges for the assessment of single cases. From
   a conceptual point of view, a more consistent definition of Criterion A
   in terms of impairments in ``capacities{''} could allow for a more
   coherent distinction from maladaptive ``traits.{''} This commentary
   hopes to strengthen a discourse that moves beyond the alternatives of
   defense or abolition toward the concrete improvement of Criterion A.},

Abstract = {Social-emotional skills have been shown to be beneficial for many
   important life outcomes for students. However, previous studies on the
   topic have suffered from many issues (e.g., consideration of only a
   small subset of skills, single-informant, and single-cohort design). To
   address these limitations, this study used a multi-informant (self,
   teacher, and parent) and multicohort (ages 10-15 from Finland, N =
   5,533) perspective to study the association between 15 social-emotional
   skills and 20 educational (e.g., school grades), social (e.g.,
   relationships with teachers), psychological health (e.g., life
   satisfaction), and physical health outcomes (e.g., sleep trouble).
   Results showed that (a) there was a modest level of interrater agreement
   on social-emotional skills, with the highest agreement between students
   and parents (mean r = .41); (b) inclusion of multi-informant ratings
   substantially enhanced the ability of social-emotional skills in
   predicting outcome variables, with parent- and self-rated skills playing
   important, unique roles; (c) by modeling skills at the facet level
   rather than at the domain level, we identified the key skills for
   different outcomes and found significant variation in facets' predictive
   utility even within the same domain; and (d) although the older cohort
   showed lower levels of most social-emotional skills (9/15), there were
   only minor changes in the interrater agreement and predictive utility on
   outcomes. Overall, self-control, trust, optimism, and energy were found
   among the four most important skills for academic and life success. We
   further identified the unique contribution of each skill for specific
   outcomes, pointing the way to effective and precise interventions.},

Abstract = {Although the behaviors displayed by assessees are the currency of
   assessment centers (ACs), they have remained largely unexplored. This is
   surprising because a better understanding of assessees' behaviors may
   provide the missing link between research on the determinants of
   assessee performance and research on the validity of performance
   ratings. Therefore, this study draws on behavioral personality science
   to scrutinize the behaviors that assessees express in interpersonal AC
   exercises. Our goals were to investigate (a) the structure of
   interpersonal behaviors, (b) the consistency of these behaviors across
   AC exercises, and (c) their effectiveness. We obtained videotaped
   performances of 203 assessees who took part in AC role-plays in a
   high-stakes context. Apart from assessors' performance ratings, trained
   experts also independently coded assessees on over 40 specific
   behavioral cues in these role-plays (e.g., clear statements, upright
   posture, freezing). Results were threefold: First, the structure
   underlying behavioral differences in interpersonal AC exercises was
   represented by four broad behavioral constructs: agency, communion,
   interpersonal calmness, and intellectual competence. Second, assessees'
   behaviors showed more consistency across exercises than performance
   ratings did. Third, the behaviors were related to role-play performance
   and predicted future interpersonal performance. We discuss the
   theoretical and practical implications of this study's granular,
   behavior-driven perspective.},

Title = {Assessing distinguishable social skills in medical admission: does
   construct-driven development solve validity issues of situational
   judgment tests?},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {22},
Number = {1},
Month = {APR 20},
Abstract = {Background Social skills are important for future physicians and are
   therefore increasingly considered in selection processes. One economic
   assessment method from which different social skills can be inferred are
   Situational Judgment Tests (SJTs) in which applicants are asked to rate
   behavioral responses in context-relevant situations. However,
   traditional SJTs have so far failed to distinctively measure specified
   constructs. To address this shortcoming in the medical admission
   context, we applied a construct-driven approach of SJT development in
   which test development was deductively guided by agency and communion as
   target constructs. Method The final version of the construct-driven SJT
   includes 15 items per construct with three behavioral responses. Medical
   school applicants (N = 1527) completed the construct-driven SJT, a
   traditional SJT, and an aptitude test under high-stakes condition as
   part of their application. A subsample (N = 575) participated in a
   subsequent voluntary online study with self-report measures of
   personality and past behavior. Results The proposed two-factor structure
   and internal consistency of the construct-driven SJT was confirmed.
   Communal SJT scores were positively associated with self-reported
   communal personality and communal behavior, yet effects were smaller
   than expected. Findings for agentic SJT scores were mixed with positive
   small associations to self-reported agentic personality scores and
   agentic behavior but unexpected negative relations to communal
   self-reported measures. Conclusions Results suggest that
   construct-driven SJTs might overcome validity limitations of traditional
   SJTs, although their implementation is challenging. Despite first
   indicators of validity, future research needs to address practical
   points of application in high-stakes settings, inclusion of other
   constructs, and especially prediction of actual behavior before the
   application of construct-driven SJTs for selection purposes in medical
   admission can be recommended.},

Abstract = {Everyone can achieve life success if they can fulfil the prerequisites.
   There is no dominant factor that determines success, but the strength of
   character can be an essential asset that is not in doubt. This study
   aims to explore the Yahanu character strengths in the phenomenon of
   achieving life success of three santri, graduates of the same pesantren
   (Islamic boarding school) in Indonesia. We design this research with a
   phenomenological approach. We collected the data through in-depth
   interviews, then transcribed it verbatim into a solid description, and
   analyzed it through descriptive-psychological phenomenological analysis
   procedures. The findings show that: (1) Yahanu is more of a performance
   character than a moral character; (2) Five traits that become Yahanu's
   elements: courage, confidence, efficacy, learning readiness, and grit
   drive the spirit of leadership, pioneering, activism, and risk-taking;
   and (3) The intersection of the four strengthens the skills to think/act
   strategically, adapt, be creative, and communicate. These findings
   further prove a strong correlation between character strength and life
   success, which is helpful for parents, education practitioners, and
   policymakers to design character education, especially at primary and
   secondary levels.},

Title = {Theoretical Foundations for Education of Positive Behavior Skills Among
   Young Athletes: A Qualitative Study},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY EDUCATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Pages = {148-160},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The increase in aggressiveness and disrespect to their peers in
   physically active teenagers and adolescents has become a major topic in
   the academic world. Risky behavior in teenagers has been attributed to
   biological, psychological and social factors. Therefore, it is essential
   to pay much attention to educational programs that develop a person's
   physical, emotional, social and cognitive aspects. It has been concluded
   that positive behavior skills education may be beneficial in personality
   development. However, there are not many educational programs based on
   the current theoretical knowledge about the development of positive
   behavior skills. In addition to this, no educational program, that is
   based on the positive behavior skills, has been applied in the education
   of young sportspeople. The aim of our qualitative study was to analyze
   the theoretical foundations for education of positive behavior skills
   among young athletes. This qualitative study is based on a directed
   content analysis strategy. The methods used in the course of this study
   are analysis of academic literature, synthesis, summarizing, grouping
   and comparing. It has been highlighted that the construct of positive
   behavior skills comprises positive personal, positive social and
   positive emotional skills, that create a multi-layered structural model
   of positive behavior skills. The types of positive personal, positive
   social and positive emotional behavior skills are crucial when putting
   together educational programs for young sportspeople and their
   well-being. Concluding the results of our theoretical analysis, positive
   social, positive personal and positive emotional skills should be
   prioritized in educational programs that develop young athletes'
   positive behavior skills.},

Abstract = {People differ in their social, emotional, and behavioral (SEB) skills:
   their capacities to maintain social relationships, regulate emotions,
   and manage goal- and learning-directed behaviors. In five studies using
   data from seven independent samples (N = 6,309), we address three key
   questions about the nature, structure, assessment, and outcomes of SEB
   skills. First, how can SEB skills be defined and distinguished from
   other kinds of psychological constructs, such as personality traits? We
   propose that SEB skills represent how someone is capable of thinking,
   feeling, and behaving when the situation calls for it, whereas traits
   represent how someone tends to think, feel, and behave averaged across
   situations. Second, how can specific SEB skills be organized within
   broader domains? We find that many skill facets can be organized within
   five major domains representing Social Engagement, Cooperation,
   Self-Management, Emotional Resilience, and Innovation Skills. Third, how
   should SEB skills be measured? We develop and validate the Behavioral,
   Emotional, and Social Skills Inventory (BESSI) to measure individuals'
   capacity to enact specific behaviors representing 32 skill facets. We
   then use the BESSI to investigate the nomological network of SEB skills.
   We show that both skill domains and facets converge in conceptually
   meaningful ways with socioemotional competencies, character and
   developmental strengths, and personality traits, and predict
   consequential outcomes including academic achievement and engagement,
   occupational interests, social relationships, and well-being. We believe
   that this work provides the most comprehensive model currently available
   for conceptualizing SEB skills, as well as the most psychometrically
   robust tool available for assessing them.},

   psychology has a prescribed set of four responsibilities that it
   implicitly or explicitly tackles as a field: (a) describing what
   personality is-i.e., what the units of analysis in the field are; (b)
   documenting how it develops; (c) explaining the processes of personality
   and why they affect functioning; and (d) providing a framework for
   understanding individuals and explaining their actions, feelings, and
   motivations. We review progress made over the last 20 years to address
   these four agendas and conclude by highlighting future directions and

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to examine the relevance of a set of

   players (ages 15-19 years) from a French-speaking part of Switzerland
   was based on McAdams' framework. Data were processed to identify main
   team characteristics and differences between subgroups compared to
   standard values. Results suggested needs for psychological support in
   four domains: (a) management of emotional stability to reduce anxiety
   regarding performance and interactions with coaches; (b) enhancement of
   involvement in practice, including conscientiousness, quality of
   practice, and building positive and supportive relationships with
   coaches; (c) protection against substance abuse and doping; and (d)

Abstract = {Over the past 2 years, numerous empirical studies in the fields of human

   a step back and to outline several theoretical and methodological
   considerations when researching employee experiences and behavior in
   times of crisis more generally. These insights may be useful when
   developing conceptual models, designing empirical studies, and managing
   people in the context of future crises. We first review theoretical
   approaches that could be applied to explain changes in employee
   experiences and behavior in times of crisis, including stress theories,
   theories of adjustment to work-related changes, career construction
   theory, event system theory, transition-adaptation theories, the crisis
   management and resilience framework, and the social identity model of
   identity change. Second, we outline methodological considerations and
   best practices regarding the research design of quantitative empirical
   studies, sampling, measurement, and analytic strategies. Throughout, we
   highlight empirical studies on employee experiences and behavior during
   the COVID-19 pandemic that have adopted these theoretical approaches and
   methodological best practices. We conclude with several suggestions for
   future theory development and empirical studies on employee experiences

Abstract = {In recent years, there has been a growing interest in social and
   emotional skills (SES) both in the scientific literature and in social
   practice. The paper presents an overview of the ways of understanding
   what SES are and the catalogs thereof. There are some attempts in the
   literature to organize these catalogs within the Big Five traits that
   for a long time was claimed to be the most sound model of basic
   orthogonal dimensions of personality. However, further research on
   personality structure revealed that two metatraits can be found above
   the Big Five traits. These two metatraits form the basis of the Two
   Factor Model of personality, which was later developed into the
   Circumplex of Personality Metatraits. It turned out that in certain
   aspects models based on metatraits have a greater theoretical potential
   than those based on the Big Five traits. The paper presents a proposal
   for describing SES from the perspective of the Circumplex of Personality
   Metatraits rather than the Big Five. In this framework, we distinguish
   the concept of personality competences that underlie and organize many
   specific SES and identify the core personality competencies on the basis
   of the Circumplex of Personality Metatraits model.},

Abstract = {Individual extraversion is considered to be one of the most consistent
   predictors of leadership emergence according to meta-analytic support,
   but inconsistent empirical results indicate that their relationship may
   be more nuanced than scholars have concluded. We propose two key reasons
   for why the extraversion-emergence relationship has yielded inconsistent
   results. First, we challenge one of the fundamental theoretical
   assumptions regarding why extraverts emerge as leaders, namely, that
   extraverts have high levels of communication skill. Drawing on the
   personality literature, we argue that rather than being inextricably
   linked to extraversion, communication skill not only plays a separate
   role but also may determine when extraversion relates to emergence.
   Second, we test a multilevel model accounting for the team context by
   proposing in alignment with the social identity model of leadership that
   a team's overall level of extraversion impacts the team's leadership
   prototypes and thus the importance of extraversion and communication
   skill for leadership emergence. We test our hypotheses across two
   studies in assessment center contexts. We find broad support for our
   multilevel model and show that extraversion's effects may be much more
   conditional than previously assumed, whereas communication skill may be
   a more promising explanatory factor. Thus, we provide a more complete
   understanding of why and when interpersonal characteristics relate to
   leadership emergence.},

Title = {Personality-informed intervention design: Examining how trait regulation
   can inform efforts to change behavior},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PERSONALITY},

Volume = {35},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {623-645},

Abstract = {Research that helps people change their behavior has the potential to
   improve the quality of lives, but it is too often approached in a way
   that divorces behavior from the people who need to enact it. In this
   paper, we propose a personality-informed approach to classifying
   behavior-change problems and designing interventions to address them. In
   particular, we argue that interventions will be most effective when they
   target the appropriate psychological process given the disposition of
   the participant and the desired duration of change. Considering these
   dimensions can help to reveal the differences among common types of
   behavior-change problems, and it can guide decisions about what kinds of
   intervention solutions will most effectively solve them. We review key
   concepts and findings from the personality literature that can help us
   understand the dynamic nature of dispositions and to identify the
   psychological processes that best explain both short-term variance in
   behavior and long-term development of personality. Drawing on this
   literature, we argue that different types of behavior-change problems
   require different forms of ``trait regulation,{''} and we offer a series
   of propositions to be evaluated as potential guides for the design of
   intervention strategies to address them.},

Title = {Social, Emotional, and Behavioral Skills: An Integrative Model of the
   Skills Associated With Success During Adolescence and Across the Life
   Span},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {6},
Month = {JUN 28},
Abstract = {Social, emotional, and behavioral (SEB) skills encompass a wide range of
   competencies related to how individuals build and maintain
   relationships, understand and manage emotions, pursue goals, and learn
   from experience. Despite near-consensus on the importance of SEB skills
   for success in life, there are numerous frameworks that simultaneously
   converge and diverge in how they define and measure SEB skills. In this
   article, we discuss our integrative model encompassing five broad skill
   domains: Self-Management, Innovation, Social Engagement, Cooperation,
   and Emotional Resilience Skills (Soto et al., 2021a). Our model defines
   SEB skills as skills (i.e., what someone is capable of doing) and not
   traits (i.e., what someone tends to do). Using this definition and model
   as a foundation, we argue for the importance of investigating SEB skill
   development during adolescence, a period where SEB skills may be both
   particularly amenable to change and particularly predictive of life
   outcomes. In particular, we highlight how SEB skills allow adolescents
   to take advantage of the new opportunities afforded to them as they make
   major cognitive and social transitions.},

Title = {Measuring Distinct Social Skills via Multiple Speed Assessments A
   Behavior-Focused Personnel Selection Approach},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {38},
Number = {3},
Pages = {224-236},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Social skills (e.g., persuading others, showing compassion, staying
   calm) are of key importance in work and education settings. Accordingly,
   the goal of many selection processes is to identify candidates who excel
   in desired skills. For this, high-fidelity simulations such as
   assessment centers (ACs) are regarded as ideal procedures because they
   can be used to evoke, observe, and evaluate candidates' actual behavior.
   However, research has repeatedly shown that observed performance
   differences in ACs are not sufficiently driven by the specific skill
   dimensions that are defined for assessment. Building on multiple speed
   assessments and incorporating insights from behavioral personality
   science, we offer an alternative approach for the reliable and valid
   assessment of distinct social skills. We hereby (a) selected skills on
   the basis of a bottom-up analysis of observable and distinguishable
   interpersonal behaviors and (b) specifically designed exercises around
   these skills (i.e., one skill per exercise, multiple exercises per
   skill). Here, we present the initial results of this newly developed
   procedure across three samples in a high-stakes selection context (N =
   589). Generalizability theory analyses showed that a substantial amount
   of variance in assessor ratings could be attributed to the selected
   skills. This underlines the importance of more behaviorally focused
   selection procedures.},

Title = {Evolutionary benefits of personality traits when facing workplace
   bullying},
Journal = {PERSONALITY AND INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {177},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Facing workplace bullying negatively affects physical and mental health,
   and consequently quality of life and well-being. Personality traits that
   can help an individual survive and reproduce entail more benefits than
   costs. Building on two evolutionary theories, Life History Theory and
   Costly Signaling Theory, this study aims to provide novel insights into
   how and why personality traits are associated with facing workplace
   bullying and health-related quality of life. A heterogeneous group of
   324 employees in Sweden provided data on workplace bullying, perceived
   health-related quality of life, and personality traits, controlling for
   sex and age. We found that openness (HEXACO model) and Machiavellianism
   (Dark Triad model) served as moderators. Employees with high values of
   these traits experienced significantly less affected health-related
   quality of life when facing workplace bullying. Our results indicate
   evolutionary origins of the personality traits openness and
   Machiavellianism. A new finding is that possessing, exhibiting, and
   maintaining traits reflecting a more creative and competitive
   interpersonal style increases an employee?s ability to survive aversive
   environments.},

Title = {Towards an Integrative Taxonomy of Social-Emotional Competences},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Month = {MAR 11},
Abstract = {Social-emotional competences are critical for positive development and
   significantly predict educational and occupational attainment, health,
   and well-being. There is however a lack of consensus about the number of
   core competences, and how these are defined and operationalized. This
   divergence in approach challenges future research as well as the
   scientific usefulness of the construct. In an effort to create an
   integrative framework, this focused review evaluates different
   approaches of conceptualizing and assessing social-emotional
   competences. Building on shared conceptions, an integrative taxonomy
   ``DOMASEC{''} is introduced, specifying core domains and manifestations
   of social-emotional competences that bridge across frameworks focusing
   on social and emotional learning, personality traits (such as the Big
   Five) and self-determination theory. Core domains include intrapersonal,
   interpersonal and task-oriented competencies, differentiating between
   affective, cognitive, and behavioral manifestations of competences
   across these domains. It is argued that the integrative taxonomy
   facilitates the conceptual specification of key constructs, that it
   helps to better organize the multitude of terms and definitions used,
   and to guide the conceptualization and operationalization of
   social-emotional competences and their various facets.},

   Global and Broad Emotional Abilities of the Geneva Emotional Competence
   Test},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Drawing upon multidimensional theories of intelligence, the current
   paper evaluates if the Geneva Emotional Competence Test (GECo) fits
   within a higher-order intelligence space and if emotional intelligence
   (EI) branches predict distinct criteria related to adjustment and
   motivation. Using a combination of classical and S-1 bifactor models, we
   find that (a) a first-order oblique and bifactor model provide excellent
   and comparably fitting representation of an EI structure with
   self-regulatory skills operating independent of general ability, (b)
   residualized EI abilities uniquely predict criteria over general
   cognitive ability as referenced by fluid intelligence, and (c) emotion
   recognition and regulation incrementally predict grade point average
   (GPA) and affective engagement in opposing directions, after controlling
   for fluid general ability and the Big Five personality traits. Results
   are qualified by psychometric analyses suggesting only emotion
   regulation has enough determinacy and reliable variance beyond a general
   ability factor to be treated as a manifest score in analyses and
   interpretation. Findings call for renewed, albeit tempered, research on
   EI as a multidimensional intelligence and highlight the need for refined
   assessment of emotional perception, understanding, and management to
   allow focused analyses of different EI abilities.},
