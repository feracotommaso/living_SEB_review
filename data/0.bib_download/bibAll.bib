  abstract={While personality trait assessments are widely used in candidate selection, coaching, and occupational counseling, little published research has systematically compared occupations in personality traits. Using a comprehensive personality assessment, we mapped 263 occupations in self-reported Big Five domains and various personality nuances in a sample of 68,540 individuals and cross-validated the findings in informant ratings of 19,989 individuals. Controlling for age and gender, occupations accounted for 2%–7% of Big Five variance in both self-reports and informant reports. Most occupations’ average Big Five levels were intuitive, replicated across rating methods, and were consistent with those previously obtained with a brief assessment in a different sociocultural context. Often, they also tracked the Occupational Information Network database’s work style ratings and clustered along the International Standard Classification of Occupation’s hierarchical framework. Finally, occupations with higher average levels of the personality domains typically linked to better job performance tended to be more homogeneous in these domains, suggesting that jobs with higher performing incumbents are often more selective for personality traits. Several personality nuances had intuitive occupational differences that were larger than those of the Big Five domains (explaining up to 12% variance) and replicated well across rating methods, providing more detailed insights into how job incumbents vary in personality. We provide an interactive application for exploring the results (https://apps.psych.ut.ee/JobProfiles/) and discuss the findings’ theoretical and practical implications. © 2024 The Author(s)},

  abstract={Students’ academic achievement is a central predictor of a long list of important educational outcomes, such as access to higher education and socioeconomic success. Prior studies have extensively focused on identifying variables that are related to academic achievement and an important variable in this context appears to be students’ personality. Notably, although findings from more recent studies suggested that the association between student achievement and personality varies by the subject domain (language vs. STEM) and the type of achievement measure (grades vs. test scores), systematic meta-analytical evidence is still lacking. To address this gap in the educational research literature, we conducted a meta-analysis based on 78 studies, with 1491 effect sizes representing data from 500,218 students and 110 samples from elementary to high school. We used a random-effects model with robust variance estimation to calculate mean effect sizes and standard deviations. We found moderating effects of measure or domain for all five personality traits, with differences in the direction of the effects. Our results highlight the importance of the domain and measure when examining how personality traits relate to academic achievement in school. The combination of subject domain and achievement was also found to be relevant for some of the traits. These findings emphasize that subject domains and types of achievement measures should be explicitly considered when investigating the personality saturation of student achievement. We discuss implications for future research, highlighting that there is no “best” or “more objective” achievement measure but, instead, that achievement measures should be chosen based on the research question of interest. © 2023, The Author(s).},

  abstract={Assessment refers to a broad array of approaches for measuring or evaluating a person's (or group of persons') skills, behaviors, dispositions, or other attributes. Assessments range from standardized tests used in admissions, employee selection, licensure examinations, and domestic and international large-scale assessments of cognitive and behavioral skills to formative K–12 classroom curricular assessments. The various types of assessments are used for a wide variety of purposes, but they also have many common elements, such as standards for their reliability, validity, and fairness—even classroom assessments have standards. We believe the future of assessment will involve a shift in emphasis on what skills will be measured, innovations in how we go about measuring them, the use of advanced technologies for test operations, and an expansion in the value and kinds of information that test takers will receive from taking the assessment. In this paper, we argue and provide evidence for our belief that the future of assessment contains challenges but is promising. The challenges include risks associated with security and exposure of personal data, test score bias, and inappropriate test uses, all of which may be exacerbated by the growing infiltration of artificial intelligence (AI) into our lives. The promise is increasing opportunities for testing to help individuals achieve their education and career goals and contribute to well-being and overall quality of life. To help achieve this promise we focus on the evidence-based science of measurement in education and workplace learning, a theme throughout this paper. © 2024 Educational Testing Service.},

  abstract={This study examined the impact of STEAM Maker Instruction (SMI) on the acquisition of a third language, and the development of socioemotional skills among multi-ethnic undergraduates (n = 265). By integrating the 5E instructional model with 36 real-world business projects, this study aimed to bridge the gap between traditional multiethnic classrooms and societal expectations. Analysis of the data indicated that socioemotional skills are essential in managing students’ anxiety and aspirations, which in turn fosters their creativity and academic performance in English for Specific Purposes (ESP). The 5E model significantly improved students’ business knowledge, learning skills, and attitudes, including learning capacity, social interaction, self-regulation, open innovation, team collaboration, and creativity. Social interactions, which rely on self-regulation, self-management, and resilience, were found to be essential for fostering creativity. This study demonstrated that SMI can develop socioemotional skills through engagement with real-world business projects. It offers a pathway for multicultural classroom teaching by incorporating SMI into undergraduate curricula. Nonetheless, this study acknowledges certain limitations, such as the limited sample size and concentration in a specific academic field. Future research should explore the long-term effects of socio-emotional skills and academic outcomes beyond the classroom. This includes examining the relationships among emotional engagement, behavioral engagement, and self-efficacy in the context of career decision-making strategies. © 2025 The Author(s).

  abstract={This article addresses a fundamental question in the study of socio-emotional skills, personality traits, and related constructs: “To score or not to score?” When researchers use test scores or scale scores (i.e., fallible point estimates of a skill or trait) as predictors in multiple regression, measurement error in these scores tends to attenuate regression coefficients for the skill and inflate those of the covariates. Unlike for cognitive assessments, it is not fully established how severe this bias can be in socio-emotional skill assessments, that is, how well test scores recover the true regression coefficients — compared with methods designed to account for measurement error: structural equation modeling (SEM) and plausible values (PV). The different types of scores considered in this study are standardized mean scores (SMS), regression factor scores (RFS), empirical Bayes modal (EBM) score, weighted maximum likelihood estimates (WLE), and expected a posteriori (EAP) estimates. We present a simulation study in which we compared these approaches under conditions typical of socio-emotional skill and personality assessments. We examined the performance of five types of test scores, PV, and SEM with regard to two outcomes: (1) percent bias in regression coefficient of the skill in predicting an outcome; and (2) percent bias in the regression coefficient of a covariate. We varied the number of items, factor loadings/item discriminations, sample size, and relative strength of the relationship of the skill with the outcome. Results revealed that whereas different types of test scores were highly correlated with each other, the ensuing bias in regression coefficients varied considerably. The magnitude of bias was highest for WLE with short scales of low reliability. Bias when using SMS or WLE test scores was sometimes large enough to lead to erroneous research conclusions with potentially adverse implications for policy and practice (up to 55% for the regression coefficient of the skill and 20% for that of the covariate). EAP, EBM, and RFS performed better, producing only small bias in some conditions. Additional analyses showed that the performance of test scores also depended on whether standardized or unstandardized scores were used. Only PV and SEM performed well in all scenarios and emerged as the clearly superior options. We recommend that researchers use SEM, and preferably PV, in studies on the (incremental) predictive power of socio-emotional skills. © Copyright © 2021 Bhaktha and Lechner.},

  abstract={In this article, we respond to four commentaries (Li et al., 2024; Hennecke & Ingold, 2025; Perossa & Connelly, 2024; Ones et al., 2024) on our article “Personality development goals at work: A new frontier in personality assessment in organizations.” We start by addressing four overarching considerations from the commentaries, including (a) how to approach PDG assessment, (b) the feasibility of personality development interventions, (c) potential trade-offs involved, and (d) the value of personality development beyond established HR practices. Next, in an attempt to integrate these considerations and stimulate future research in this area, we outline three critical elements of what we believe can be the foundation of theory-based personality development interventions at work. For this purpose, we first posit that personality development at work can be rethought such that the focus shifts from “changing an employee's trait levels” to “expanding that employee's comfort zone across a range of personality states.” Second, to have sustained effects, interventions need to accomplish more than simply “learning new behaviors,” by effectively targeting all layers of personality—behavioral, cognitive, and emotional. Finally, we introduce optimal functioning, encompassing both performance and well-being aspects, as the ultimate criterion for evaluating the success of personality development interventions. We hope these reactions and integrative ideas will inspire future research on personality development goals assessment and personality development interventions in the work context. © 2025 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

  abstract={Recognition and enhancement of emotional and social development of children and students is part of the teachers’ tasks. The paper outlines the results of the development of a scale for discrimination of the reactions of typically developing children and students, children and students with special educational needs (SEN), chronic illnesses, at risk and gifted by in-service kindergarten and pimary teachers in mainstream seƫting. The responses of 103 teachers who work in groups and classes covering all five categories of children and students indicated that they distinguished between the specific positive and negative reactions, highlighting emotional and social development. The 245 items used demonstrated how children and students were categorised and formed 10 subscales of desired and undesired behaviours. Positive reactions of gifted children were rated highest, followed by typically developing children. The positive reactions of children and students with SEN and at-risk had the lowest scores, where their negative reactions further had the highest scores. The scale can be used as a screening tool as well for identification and prevention not only of externalized behaviors, but also for deepening teachers’ skills in recognizing and taking action on referral, teamwork, and interactions aimed at overall personal development, of which emotional and social competencies are an essential part. © 2024, Bulgarian Psychiatric Association (BPA).

  abstract={This entry addresses issues associated with the assessment of interpersonal and intrapersonal skills and reviews key findings. Terminology issues have been a source of confusion within and outside the field. Terminology suggests hundreds of constructs, but several proposed frameworks and crosswalk approaches promise to provide order to enable the steady accumulation of knowledge. The entry lists several key conclusions about interpersonal and intrapersonal assessment and evidence to support those conclusions. These are that (a) interpersonal and intrapersonal skills assessments predict academic outcomes and (b) non-academic outcomes; (c) unlike the case with cognitive abilities, there are multiple, distinct interpersonal and intrapersonal skills, (d) interpersonal and intrapersonal skills appear to change over time but not in exactly the same way cognitive skills do, (e) interpersonal and intrapersonal skills can be improved, (f) there are some subgroup differences in interpersonal and intrapersonal skills, but they are smaller than and different from cognitive skill differences, (g) others'-assessments of interpersonal and intrapersonal skills are more predictive of outcomes than self-assessments, but the two provide complementary, not duplicative information, (h) noncognitive and cognitive skills are distinct but they overlap and are difficult to disentangle, and (i) there are various uses for interpersonal and intrapersonal skills assessments and stakes make a difference. The entry describes the four major categories of interpersonal and intrapersonal skills assessment methods: ratings (self and other), multidimensional forced-choice rankings, situational judgment tests, and performance tests.

  abstract={The aim of this chapter is to better integrate the literatures on self-regulation and character. Using modern conceptualizations of both constructs, we argue that the relationship between self-regulation and character is bidirectional. Specifically, we propose two organizing theses regarding this relationship: (1) self-regulation allows a person to live an active, agentic, purpose-driven, character-oriented life; and (2) a person’s patterns of self-regulation can be considered a key aspect of their character and character development. To support these positions, we review three “modes” of self-regulation research, describing how work from each mode may relate to character: (1) the life-span developmental perspective; (2) the personality psychology perspective; and (3) the social, emotional, and behavioral skills perspective. Our review does not privilege any one mode of self-regulation research above another. Instead, we argue that each perspective provides valuable insight into character, and propose that the study of character may in fact provide a rare opportunity for “cross-pollination” across the modes of self-regulation research. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Michael D.

Across six studies, employing multiple modes of assessment, we examine the differential associations of tendencies toward feeling powerful and desiring power with a range of interpersonal functioning variables. Feeling powerful was associated with more harmonious interpersonal tendencies (e.g., agreeableness, empathy), whereas desiring power was associated with less harmonious interpersonal tendencies (e.g., hostility, Machiavellianism).

  abstract={Academic Abstract: This paper aims to motivate research on emotion regulation success in naturalistic settings. We define emotion regulation success as achieving one’s emotion regulation goal and differentiate it from related concepts (i.e., maladaptive regulation and dysregulation). As goals vary across individuals and situations, it is insufficient to conceptualize emotion regulation success as maximizing positive affect and minimizing negative affect. Instead, emotion regulation success can be measured through novel approaches targeting the achievement of emotion regulation goals. In addition to utilizing novel data analytic tools (e.g., response surface analyses), future research can make use of informant reports and observing ambulatory behavior or physiology. Considering emotion regulation goals when measuring daily emotion regulation success has the potential to answer key questions about personality, development, and mental health. Public Abstract: People differ in how they want to feel in daily situations (e.g., excited) and why they want to feel that way (e.g., to make others feel better), depending on factors such as culture or age. Although people manage their emotions to reach these goals, most research assessing emotion regulation success has not taken individual goals into account. When assessing if people successfully regulate their emotions, most research in daily life has been focused on whether people feel more positive or less negative. To help study emotion regulation success in a more thoughtful and inclusive way, we propose a new approach to conceptualizing emotion regulation success that incorporates individual differences in what motivates people to regulate and discuss future research directions and applications. © 2023 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.},

  abstract={Business leaders and HR professionals have long recognized the importance of social skills for effective organizational functioning, particularly in roles requiring high levels of interpersonal interaction. Accordingly, organizational science scholars have produced a large amount of research that can be organized under the broad heading of social skills. Yet, three key issues in the literature are hampering progress: (1) the lack of a well-accepted articulation of the social skills phenomenon, what it is and what it is not; (2) conceptual redundancy and conflation among the set of social skills-related concepts (e.g., individual differences, skills, behavior, evaluations, etc.), and (3) full consideration of the importance of social behavior in understanding social skills. We propose solutions for understanding social skills that begin to resolve these issues and help strengthen future empirical research. Specifically, we present two distinct, but related, conceptualizations of social skills: social skills enactment and social skills reputation. We then offer a theoretically grounded perspective, the Social Skills Framework, which incorporates these conceptualizations of social skills, provides a structure into which existing social skills concepts can be integrated and evaluated for conceptual clarity, and centers social behavior. After describing the framework, we offer a research agenda that focuses on refining the framework and investigating key issues related to the two conceptualizations of social skills. © The Author(s) 2023.},

  abstract={Plants-related microbial diversity encloses symbionts, protecting their host against several antagonisms. Microbial diversity was recognized as a critical factor in neutralizing diseases and can be carried out as a biomarker in plant protection strategies. Microorganism excites germination and plant growth, prevents infections, and incubates stress-related resistance and general fitness. Plants form favorable symbioses with a variety of microbes. Among these, some of the best understood are the root-correlated arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, rhizobial, and actinobacterial symbioses. The rhizosphere and the significance of rhizospheric microorganisms in the conservation of roots against soil-borne pathogens were discovered. Also, the connection of microorganisms with their host plant was found. Plant–microbe symbiosis is one of the fascinating connections in the living world. It must be harnessed to feed an ever-increasing human population while preserving the agroecosystem’s balance, diversity, and productivity in an environmentally benign manner. High crop yields in an ecologically sustainable way are an urgent requirement today. Using helpful and diverse plant growth–promoting microorganisms can help tackle the challenge of increasing yields without disrupting the environment, resulting in long-term sustainability. How microbes and plants communicate shows that root exudates initiate and modify communication between plant roots and soil microorganisms. This chapter aims to demonstrate rhizosphere communications, particularly between plants and microbes and, more specifically, signaling pathways that allow bacteria to sense a wide variety of plant signals to coordinate gene expression at the population and community level. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract={Assessing psychological indicators such as positive behavioral skills in the context of adolescent personality development during the pandemic era is highly relevant: the growing problem of peer disrespect among adolescents who participate in sports has recently become an undeniable scientific issue. This study aimed to analyze positive behavioral skills in the cadet (U16) and junior (U18) age groups of young basketball players during the COVID-19 pandemic. The participants were 378 male athletes (age 16.36 ± 1.15 years). Results revealed that U18 athletes are more capable of taking responsibility, positively evaluating themselves, behaving pro-socially with teammates, cooperating, demonstrating assertiveness, demonstrating self-control, and managing emotions than U16 adolescent athletes. When comparing the effect sizes in the current study during the pandemic with similar studies by other authors, the pandemic may have had a larger negative effect on some positive behavioral skills (ability to control emotions, social responsibility skills, cooperation skills) in U16 athletes than in U18 athletes, as the effect sizes were small before the pandemic and moderate during the pandemic in the current study. This study’s results may be useful for developing and implementing a young athletes’ education program based on a comprehensive model of positive behavioral skills that include the indicators analyzed. © 2023 by the authors.},

In the first phase (the 1900s through 1970s), theories of adolescence were reductionistic and research on adolescence was largely descriptive. Major shifts occurred during the second phase (the 1970s through 1990s), as theories of adolescent development were inspired by non-reductionist, relational concepts, and longitudinal studies allowed researchers to test these theories. The third phase (the 1990s onward) is characterized by the synthesis of theory, research, application, and advocacy. In particular, third phase work has increasingly focused on historically marginalized and/or minoritized youth. © 2024 Elsevier Inc. All rights are reserved.},

  abstract={Everyone can achieve life success if they can fulfil the prerequisites. There is no dominant factor that determines success, but the strength of character can be an essential asset that is not in doubt. This study aims to explore the Yahanu character strengths in the phenomenon of achieving life success of three santri, graduates of the same pesantren (Islamic boarding school) in Indonesia. We design this research with a phenomenological approach. We collected the data through in-depth interviews, then transcribed it verbatim into a solid description, and analyzed it through descriptive-psychological phenomenological analysis procedures. The findings show that: (1) Yahanu is more of a performance character than a moral character; (2) Five traits that become Yahanu's elements: courage, confidence, efficacy, learning readiness, and grit drive the spirit of leadership, pioneering, activism, and risk-taking; and (3) The intersection of the four strengthens the skills to think/act strategically, adapt, be creative, and communicate. These findings further prove a strong correlation between character strength and life success, which is helpful for parents, education practitioners, and policymakers to design character education, especially at primary and secondary levels. © Copyright 2022: Saiful Amien, Punaji Setyosari, Nurul Murtadho, Sulton, and Nova Southeastern University.},

  abstract={Is Conscientiousness a useful construct across cultures? Using the 2012 Program for International Student Assessment data, we examined whether perseverance, a measure of Conscientiousness, was related to achievement and truancy across 62 countries/regions (N?> 470,000). We investigated whether these relationships were linear or curvilinear in nature and assessed the utility of item-level information. After establishing partial metric invariance of the perseverance measure across various countries/regions and cultural regions, our findings unveiled that perseverance consistently predicted both math achievement and truancy, with predominantly linear associations. Notably, among the five items of the Perseverance scale, the item reflecting one’s tendency to give up easily in the face of challenges emerged as the strongest and most consistent predictor of math achievement. Further, country-level correlations between perseverance and both math achievement and truancy displayed contradictory patterns compared to individual-level correlations, suggesting the presence of biasing factors in how people respond to these measures. Nonetheless, it appears reasonable to conclude that measures of Conscientiousness are pan-cultural predictors of achievement and truancy. © 2024 American Psychological Association},

Objective: The aim of this study is to assess the psychometric properties of a Spanish version of the resilience subscale of the BESSI-45. Method: The BESSI-45 was administered to 625 adolescents from three different regions of Peru. The resilience subscale was evaluated in terms of norms, internal consistency, factorial structure, factorial invariance, and Item Response Theory (IRT)-based characteristics. Results: Internal consistency was adequate (omega = 0.8243), the factor analysis showed a unidimensional structure with good fit indices, and factorial invariance was demonstrated across gender and geographic region. The discrimination ability according to IRT was satisfactory for all items. The most important items were three related to anger control and impulsivity. Conclusion: In the study sample of Peruvian adolescents, the resilience subscale of the BESSI-45 shows adequate psychometric characteristics based on its factorial structure, internal consistency and IRT. © 2024 Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia, Facultad de Medicina Alberto Hurtado.

  abstract={Personality traits and social, emotional, and behavioral (SEB) skills are closely related but incrementally predict life outcomes. This implies that although tightly connected, what a person tends to do (personality traits) and what they are capable of doing (skills) are not always perfectly aligned. In this study, we investigated whether matches and mismatches between traits and skills predict important life outcomes. We studied a diverse sample of high school students (N = 840) who self-reported their Big Five personality traits, five SEB skill domains, and an array of academic, social, and emotional outcomes. Using response surface analysis, we found that matching trait/skill levels did not confer a unique benefit for adolescents over the additive effects of traits and skills. In contrast, we found that trait/skill mismatches predicted outcomes, and in some cases, adolescents with mismatching trait/skills had the best and worst outcomes. Specifically, youth with higher skill levels relative to their traits reported better outcomes, and those with lower skills relative to their traits reported worse outcomes. Our findings provide insights into functioning that are missed by solely focusing on direct effects and show that SEB skills can enhance youth's personality strengths and buffer against shortcomings.},

  language={English},
  abstract={Recent research has examined similarities and differences between traits and skills. It may be the case that traits and skills can be measured interchangeably with one providing little to no incremental validity over the other. However, methodological limitations constrain our ability to draw firm conclusions. Work in this area thus far has only examined self-reports and single-stimulus Likert items. We carried out two studies to try to determine the extent to which methodology influences observed trait-skill similarity. In Study 1, we collected both self- and observer-reports of traits and skills, and in Study 2, we used both Likert and forced choice items. We examined whether trait-skill similarity in scores and validity evidence varied according to rater and item type. Our findings suggest that trait-skill similarity is unaffected by rater but is affected by item type; forced choice items lend themselves to greater trait-skill similarity.},

  journal={LEARNING AND INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES},
  volume={118},
  author={Lechner, Clemens M. and Urban, Julian},
  language={English},
  abstract={This paper explores inequalities in adolescents' social, emotional, and behavioral skills. We examine whether skills vary by gender, parental education, immigrant background, school track-and their intersections. In two samples of German adolescents (age 14-20y; N = 3162), we fielded the Behavioral, Emotional, and SelfRegulatory Skills Inventory (BESSI), enabling a fine-grained assessment of 32 skill facets from five domains. Analyses revealed skill advantages for youth whose parents completed academic education and youth without immigrant background across most skills. Gender and school track had more varied effects mostly in favor of girls and adolescents attending academic tracks. Inequalities tended to be most pronounced for Innovation Skills. Intersectional analyses suggested that skill inequalities across intersectional strata (i.e., combinations of social categories) arose primarily from main effects of social categories, rather than intersectional interactions. We conclude that inequalities in SEB skills are small but systematic and unfold primarily as main effects. Educational relevance and implications: Our research explored whether adolescents differ in their levels of social, emotional, and behavioral (SEB) skills depending on their gender, immigrant background, parents' education, and school track. We found that parents' education and immigrant background were the factors generating most consistent inequalities in SEB skills, with skill advantages for adolescents whose parents completed academic education and autochthonous adolescents across all skill domains and most skill facets, especially in Innovation Skills (e.g., information processing, creative skill, abstract thinking skill). Gender differences and, to a lesser extent, differences by school track were also present but more varied in terms of which subgroup showed skill advantages: On most skills, girls showed skill advantages over boys (with the exception of Emotional Resilience), as did and adolescents attending an academic school track over those attending a vocational track. We further established that inequalities in SEB skills mainly arise from the simple effects of the social categories, rather than through complex interactions among their intersections. Our findings constitute a step towards helping educators, policymakers, and researchers identify groups of adolescents who are at a heightened need of support in developing SEB skills. This may help in developing targeted interventions and policies aimed at fostering equitable development of SEB skills in the future. Addressing these inequalities is essential for reducing educational gaps and enhancing the academic success and wellbeing of all students.},

Our study focused on the bottom quartile of participants aged 10 and 15 years, including 7737 and 7439 individuals from each age group. Optimism and cooperation consistently emerged as the central skills of social-emotional competence across both age groups. When comparing network structures, there was a significant difference between children and adolescents. The connectivity of social-emotional networks was stronger among adolescents, indicating closer skill associations. Understanding these developmental differences is important for educators and practitioners to more effectively support the social-emotional development of children and adolescents experiencing social-emotional difficulties.},

In this study, we aimed to investigate the relationships of soft skills, as defined by the World Economic Forum, with two indicators of successful/healthy aging: life satisfaction and cognitive reserve. A sample of 435 adults aged 50 and over completed self-reported measures of soft skills, life satisfaction, and cognitive reserve. As control, fluid (reasoning) and crystalized (vocabulary) intelligence were assessed too, along with socio-demographic characteristics. A series of regression analyses showed that soft skills were positively related to both life satisfaction and, to a lower extent, cognitive reserve, above and beyond gender, age, and both fluid and crystallized intelligence. Interestingly, these associations were independent from participants' age. Overall, these results highlight the importance of considering soft skills also over the middle-late adult life course, due to the potential role of these individual qualities in supporting an individual's well-being and an active and engaged lifestyle, with implications for the promotion of a healthy aging.},

This study aims to address this gap by identifying the most important social-emotional skills using global data and machine learning approaches. Data from 61,585 students across nine countries, drawn from the OECD Social-Emotional Skills Survey, were analyzed (NChina = 7246, NFinland = 5482, NColombia = 13,528, NCanada = 7246, NRussia =6434, NTurkey = 5482, NSouth Korea = 7246, NPortugal=6434, and NUSA=6434). Six machine learning techniques-including Random Forest, Logistic Regression, AdaBoost, LightGBM, Artificial Neural Networks, and Support Vector Machines-were employed to identify critical social-emotional skills. The results indicated that the Random Forest algorithm performed best in the prediction models. After controlling for demographic variables, optimism, energy, and stress resistance were identified as the top three social-emotional skills contributing to both subjective well-being and physical health. Additionally, sociability and trust were found to be the fourth most important skills for well-being and physical health, respectively. These findings have significant implications for designing tailored interventions and training programs that enhance students' social-emotional skills and overall health.},

  abstract={Individuals with rare skeletal disorders like Multiple Osteochondromas and Ollier Disease often experience physical and psychological burdens. Adventure therapy, with activities like sailing in outdoor settings, promotes personal growth and psychological well-being, potentially improving health-related quality of life (HRQoL). This study aimed to evaluate the impact of a sailing program on health-related quality of life and participant satisfaction in individuals with Multiple Osteochondromas and Ollier Disease. A quasi-experimental one-group pre-post design was employed, with HRQoL assessed using the EQ-5D (R) instrument and participant satisfaction measured via a feedback survey. Data were collected before and after the five-day sailing program conducted in the Mediterranean Sea in 2022 and 2023, involving participants diagnosed with Multiple Osteochondromas and Ollier Disease. Statistical analyses were performed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and McNemar's test for paired data. A significance level of p < 0.05 and p < 0.10 was considered. A total of 25 participants, predominantly male (52\%), with a median age of 16 years (ranking from 11 to 31), were included in the study. The sailing program had mixed impact on HRQoL. Specifically, individuals who were female (p = 0.03), aged 16 and older (p = 0.04), with higher educational attainment (p = 0.10) or stronger self-management (p = 0.09), resilience (p = 0.01) and self-engagement (p = 0.09) skills experienced enhanced HRQoL. Conversely, other participants exhibited an increase in self-care difficulties (p = 0.02) and a trend towards worsening pain/discomfort (p = 0.38). Overall satisfaction with the program was high, with 90\% of participants expressing satisfaction. This is the first study which examined HRQoL in Multiple Osteochondromas and Ollier Disease patients within an outdoor adventure therapy setting. Findings suggest that adventure therapy, integrated into healthcare strategies, may offer a valuable complement to conventional treatments for rare skeletal disorders. Future research, including randomized controlled trials, are necessary to confirm these results and develop robust interventions for improving the well-being in this population.},

  abstract={People's subjective beliefs about themselves affect what people think and, consequently, what they do. Positive self-beliefs are important for many life outcomes, from academic success to well-being, especially during K-12 education as a crucial developmental period. Many empirical studies and meta-analyses have examined correlates of self-beliefs. The present second-order meta-analytic review integrates this large and diverse body of research, addressing two research aims: First, we examined the comparative strength of different variables related to self-beliefs. Second, we provide a methodological review of meta-analyses in this area, thereby facilitating readers' ability to assess the risk of bias when interpreting the results. We summarized 105 first-order meta-analyses published before July 2023 that investigated variables associated with self-beliefs during K-12 education, comprising 493 first-order effect sizes based on more than 8,500 primary studies and more than 16 million children and adolescents. We computed second-order standardized mean differences (SMD) using two-level meta-analyses with robust variance estimation. Personal characteristics (SMD = 0.50) showed stronger relations with self-beliefs than interventions (SMD = 0.27). Achievement (SMD = 0.66) and noncognitive variables (SMD = 0.67) were the personal characteristics most strongly related to self-beliefs compared to cognitive abilities (SMD = 0.30) and background variables (SMD = 0.21). Interventions targeting individual characteristics (SMD = 0.35) and especially self-beliefs (SMD = 0.52) showed larger effect sizes than interventions that focused on improving teaching and classroom structure (SMD = 0.20). Few meta-analyses investigated situational aspects, such as the geographical origin of the sample, in association with children's and adolescents' self-beliefs. Overall, this second-order meta-analytic review provides a comprehensive map of correlates of the self, highlighting pathways for future research.},

  abstract={Introduction: Soft skills, also known as transversal skills, have gained significant attention in the organizational context due to their positive impact on various work-related outcomes. The present study aimed to develop and validate the Multiple Soft Skills Assessment Tool (MSSAT), a short self-report instrument that evaluates interpersonal skills (initiative-resourcefulness, assertiveness, conflict management), interpersonal communication skills, decision-making style (adaptive and maladaptive), and moral integrity. Methods: The scale development process involved selecting and adapting relevant items from existing scales and employing a cross-validation approach with a large sample of workers from diverse organizational settings and job positions (N=639). In the first step, 28 items were carefully chosen from an item pool of 64 items based on their content, factor loadings, item response theory analyses, differential item functioning, and fit statistics. Next, the structure of the resulting scale was evaluated through confirmatory factor analyses. Results: The MSSAT demonstrated gender invariance and good reliability and validity. The results of a network analysis confirmed the relationships between soft skills and positive work-related outcomes. Notably, interpersonal communication skills and moral integrity emerged as crucial skills. Discussion: The MSSAT is a valuable tool for organizations to assess the soft skills of their employees, thereby contributing to design targeted development programs.},

  abstract={The relationship between early school- and family-related factors and later psychological well-being (PWB) has been insufficiently studied. To address this gap, a comprehensive model was employed to investigate the effects of school and family predictors (ages < 14) on PWB, and a related construct, life satisfaction (LS), at age 35 for a large urban childhood cohort. 30-year follow-up data were analyzed for 72 \% (N = 1,112) of the original 1,539 participants (93 \% Black) in the Chicago Longitudinal Study, a prospective investigation on the impact of an early childhood education program. Hierarchical linear regression analysis revealed both parent (beta = 0.51p = 0.013) and student educational attainment expectations (beta = 1.48; p = 0.032) as well as peer social skills (beta = 0.25; p = 0.003) were the most significant predictors of midlife PWB. Peer social skills (beta = 0.02; p = 0.032), school mobility (beta = -0.09; p = 0.012), and student educational attainment expectations (beta = 0.17; p = 0.022) were strongly associated with midlife LS. Sex differences were also examined. Implications for shaping key components of school-family programs, services, and policies that foster positive development across different social ecologies are discussed. Further research should explore the mediational pathways to better understand the mechanisms behind these observed relationships.},

  abstract={Given the critical role of socio-emotional skills in students' academic success, psychological well-being, and other critical life outcomes, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) developed the Survey on Social and Emotional Skills (SSES) to measure these skills among school-age students. However, the broad conceptual scope of socio-emotional skills necessitated the use of a large number of items (i.e., 120 items) in the original SSES, which poses challenges regarding survey administration and participant fatigue. To address these issues, this study aimed to develop a short form of the SSES (i.e., SSES-SF). The sample included 29,798 15-year-old students across 10 regions. We developed a 45-item version of SSES-SF using the machine learning approach of genetic algorithm, which is 62.5\% shorter than the original 120-item SSES. The reliability, construct validity, reproduced information, concurrent validity, and measurement invariance of the SSES-SF were investigated. We found that the SSES-SF demonstrated satisfactory reliability, construct validity, and concurrent validity. Furthermore, the SSES-SF was able to reproduce a substantial amount of information from the original full-form SSES and exhibited measurement invariance across genders, regions, and language groups. Theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed.},

  abstract={Seeing a situation as a zero-sum game, where one party's success must come at the expense of another, stifles cooperation-even when such cooperation could greatly benefit both parties. Consequently, zero-sum beliefs can undermine progress when cooperation is needed for success. In this article, we propose that zero-sum thinking (any specific instance of zero-sum construals or beliefs) can also be understood as a broader mindset-a generalized belief about how the world works. Thus, the zero-sum mindset predisposes one toward zero-sum thinking, and its cognitive and strategic consequences, across situations and domains. In an investigation spanning six countries (Belgium, India, Italy, Pakistan, the United Kingdom, and United States) on three continents, and more than 10,000 unique participants, we use cross-sectional, longitudinal, and experimental methods to provide foundational evidence for the zero-sum mindset. In Studies 1-5 (Concept), we show that the zero-sum mindset is distinct from existing concepts, stable over time, and predictive of disparate instances of zero-sum thinking and its strategic implications across domains and cultures. In Studies 6-7 (Cognitions), we show that zero-sum configurations of success promote hostile interpretations of others and that the zero-sum mindset predicts this bias even in objectively non-zero-sum situations. In Studies 8-9 (Consequences), we show that the zero-sum mindset predicts lower cooperation even in situations where cooperation is a matter of life or death. These findings call attention to the way lay game theories such as the zero-sum mindset bear critical implications for the cognitions and attitudes that drive social behavior and success.},

  abstract={The role of non-cognitive skills in academic achievement has garnered increasing attention in educational research. This study explores the impact of non-cognitive skills on academic achievement in STEM and non-STEM subjects in secondary education. Survey data from 795 teachers and 12,965 students across 20 STEM schools in Kazakhstan were analyzed to examine the impact of 26 non-cognitive skills on performance in math, physics, first language, and history. Regression and mediation analyses were conducted to investigate how students' self-assessment of non-cognitive skills directly affects academic achievement and how these effects are mediated by teachers' assessments. The findings indicate that non-cognitive skills exhibit varying direct and total effects, with mediated effects showing greater consistency across different subjects. In math and physics, information processing skill and grit show the strongest direct and total effects on academic achievement. In first language and history, responsibility management and teamwork skill are most influential. Except for capacity for optimism and growth mindset, all skills demonstrated mediated effects across the four subjects. This research informs curriculum development and equitable policies by showing how non-cognitive skills impact academic performance across subjects. It studies the case of Kazakhstan, adding to global education discourse and offering valuable insights for enhancing STEM education.},

  language={English},
  abstract={Situational Judgement Tests (SJTs) are popular to screen for social skills during undergraduate medical admission as they have been shown to predict relevant study outcomes. Two different types of SJTs can be distinguished: Traditional SJTs, which measure general effective behavior, and construct-driven SJTs which are designed to measure specific constructs. To date, there has been no comparison of the predictive validity of these two types of SJTs in medical admission. With the present research, we examine whether the HAM-SJT, a traditional SJT, and the CD-SJT, a construct-driven SJT with an agentic and a communal scale, administered during undergraduate medical admission can predict OSCE (i.e., objective structured clinical examination) performance in a low-stakes (nLS = 159) and a high-stakes (nHS = 160) sample of medical students. Results showed a moderate positive relation between the communal scale of the CD-SJT and performance in OSCE stations with trained patients in the high-stakes sample (r =.20, p =.009). This SJT had also an incremental value in predicting the OSCE performance above and beyond GPA (i.e., grade point average), a science test (i.e., HAM-Nat), and gender (ss = 0.18, 95\% CI {[}0.03; 0.33], p =.020). That is, individuals who chose more communal behavioral responses in the SJT were rated more favorably in interactions with trained patients in the OSCE. A comparable correlation coefficient was observed for the HAM-SJT when controlling for range restriction due to admission (rraw = 0.14 vs. rcontrolled = 0.20). Our research provides a first indication for the predictive validity of construct-driven SJTs in high-stakes undergraduate medical admission.},

The current studies employed two university student samples (total n = 412) and comprehensively investigated associations between sense of purpose and social-emotional-behavioral skills, using multiple purpose measures. Associations were relatively similar across measures and samples, and results suggested that sense of purpose was most robustly positively associated with self-management skills. Sense of purpose also was associated with better student wellbeing (life satisfaction, college satisfaction, and student connectedness), though it was inconsistently associated with reported likelihood of degree completion. Sense of purpose largely remained a significant correlate of student wellbeing, even when accounting for SEB skill domains, although some associations between purpose and wellbeing were reduced in magnitude.},

  abstract={Whereas meta-analytic evidence has accumulated about the important role personality characteristics such as the Big Five traits play for academic performance in secondary school, less is known about the specific behavioral and emotional repertoire that drives these associations. A closer look at the facet-level of Big Five traits can provide this knowledge helping to better understand why students differ in their success at school. We therefore studied associations between Big Five facets and academic performance (grades and standardized test scores in German and mathematics) in three independent secondary student samples (Study 1 N = 3866, Study 2 N = 2290, and Study 3 N = 366), using regression analytic, structural equation modeling, and meta-analytic procedures to test facet-level associations and incremental associations above traits. We found facet-differential associations with academic performance indicators, particularly for facets of conscientiousness, openness, and extraversion. Evidence for incremental effects of facets beyond traits was weak. Self-discipline (conscientiousness) was the only facet that consistently showed incremental effects across Samples 1 and 2. The results can stimulate research and practice to identify the underlying mechanisms that drive these associations and also highlight the specific emotional and behavioral repertoire that should be supported to help students to succeed in school. People differ in the way they act, think, and feel-their personality traits-and these trait differences have been shown to be predictive for how well students perform in school. Besides findings on the broader trait level, less is known about which specific behavioral and emotional repertoire might drive these associations. A closer look at the narrower facet-level can provide this knowledge helping to better understand why students differ in their success at school. We therefore studied associations between personality facets and academic performance (grades and standardized test scores in German and mathematics) in three independent secondary student samples (Study 1 N = 3866, Study 2 N = 2290, and Study 3 N = 366) and integrated these findings later on. Particularly, we wanted to know whether facets can explain differences in academic performance above what is explained by broader traits. We found evidence for facet-specific associations with grades and test scores; however, evidence for explanations of facets above traits was weak. Self-discipline was the only facet that explained differences above what is explained by the broader trait conscientiousness.},

  abstract={Universal school-based socio-emotional learning (SEL) programs for adolescents have shown their efficacy in producing positive outcomes. The aim of the current study is to present an original school-based program and project for adolescents-Semear Valores On-air - and to assess the relationship between participation in the project and students' socio-emotional skills. Based on the character strengths and virtues model, this online school radio project aimed at promoting communication, creative thinking, adaptability, and resilience skills in adolescents and giving them the opportunity to become influential agents of well-being and citizenship. As part of the school curriculum, students were invited to create and record radio shows and podcasts. An online school radio was thus created, and it continues to broadcast all over the world, with music, daily shows, and interviews 24/7. It was developed within the framework of the Gulbenkian Academies for Knowledge, a nationwide Portuguese program, that seeks to prepare children and youth for change, to enable them to deal with complex problems, and to expand their opportunities for achievement. A quasi-experimental design, with a mixed qualitative-quantitative approach was used to analyze data collected from 112 adolescents in the second year of its implementation, in 2020-2021. Results suggest that (1) teachers' perceptions of student's socio-emotional skills in the post test showed more positive associations with the participation in the project, than participant's perceptions; (2) students identified eight types of lessons learned, the one most referred was the improvement of socio-emotional skills and learning about themselves; and (3) the combined opportunities for adolescents to learn more about themselves, to express themselves and to practice socio-emotional skills are important ingredients for their motivation and active engagement in the project. Overall, these results indicate that participation in the project is associated with positive outcomes for the adolescents and that both monitoring and evaluation data are very important to interpret the outcomes in a more comprehensive manner.},

  abstract={This longitudinal study investigated to what extent five key social-emotional skills persistence, academic buoyancy, curiosity, social engagement, and lack of loneliness were associated with adolescents' school engagement and burnout at two timepoints. Furthermore, the role of gender and socioeconomic status were examined. The data were collected from 1021 adolescents (ages 12-14) in the fall of 2021 and 2022. The results were analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM) and revealed that, in general, social-emotional skills were associated with higher school engagement and lower burnout among adolescents. Curiosity showed a strong relationship with school engagement. Moreover, persistence was associated with an increase in school engagement among adolescents with low-average socioeconomic status. High academic buoyancy and lack of loneliness were associated with decrease in burnout over the school years. The study implies that recognizing the variety of adolescent's social-emotional skills may help to better support adolescents' school engagement and protect them from burnout. Educational relevance and implications statement: According to the study findings, social-emotional skills, such as persistence and curiosity, were associated with higher school motivation and lower burnout of adolescents. These results suggest that interventions aiming to develop adolescents' social-emotional skills may promote adolescents' motivation. Supporting adolescents' social relationships in school may also protect adolescents from burning out. To better support adolescent students' motivation and well-being at school it is important to recognize the diversity of individual adolescents' needs and strengths in social-emotional skills. Therefore, sufficient education and training would be needed for teachers concerning the variety of social-emotional skills.},

  author={Roemer, Lena and Rammstedt, Beatrice and Lechner, Clemens M.},

  abstract={Social engagement skills as capacities for active interpersonal engagement are thought to conceptually differ from behavioral and motivational tendencies and to predict learning and life outcomes. We tested these assumptions on the distinct nature and relevance of social engagement skills. Quota-representative self-reports from 6987 adults in six countries showed strong relations of social engagement skills with personality facets and weaker with vocational interests. Partially supporting their distinctiveness, social engagement skills were not fully reducible to those correlates. Skills predicted self-reported learning, quality-of-life, and job outcomes, but offered little incremental validity beyond personality and interests. Results largely generalized across countries. Yet, the complex interplay between social engagement skills, individual differences, and outcomes demonstrated crosscountry variations, suggesting sensitivity to sociocontextual factors. We conclude that while social engagement skills conceptually differ from personality and interests and in themselves predict life success, they add limited empirical value beyond these constructs, at least for self-reports. Educational relevance statement: Social engagement skills are the capacities to actively engage with others. It is thought that these capacities differ from other person characteristics (e.g., behavioral or motivational tendencies), and that this distinction matters for explaining life success. Our study showed that while self-reported social engagement skills shared similarities with other person characteristics, they still had unique aspects. Moreover, social engagement skills mattered, such that more skilled adults reported higher quality-of-life, but not necessarily better learning. However, social engagement skills did not provide much extra insight into life success beyond what was already known from other person characteristics. Other than the remaining results, these complex relations between social engagement skills, person characteristics, and life success largely varied across countries. The results highlight the importance of assessing social skills in a situation-specific manner, which will be imperative for targeted educational practices in the future. Moreover, our study focused on adults, limiting applicability to youth, but results suggest that intervention efforts targeting social engagement skills may probably yield more interpersonal than academic benefits. Finally, when designing or adapting complex educational programs, practitioners should consider sociocontextual factors.},

Third, is the joint effect of SEB skills and traits additive or multiplicative? Results from a sample of real estate agents (N N = 2,992) in China extend the criterion space of SEB skills by showing self-concepts of these skills are related to self-reported work outcomes such as citizenship behaviors and job satisfaction in a conceptually meaningful way. Further analyses show that these skill-outcome relationships remain robust after accounting for effects of traits, indicating SEB skills' incremental validity beyond traits in predicting outcomes. Finally, comparisons between additive and multiplicative models show support for the former because the interaction effects of SEB skills and traits provide little meaningful information beyond the additive models.

  abstract={Arithmetic achievement holds particular significance in contemporary times; however, students continue to encounter difficulties in this domain. Researchers and organizations are actively seeking factors that can support students in navigating mathematical content. To address this gap, we propose an examination of the role played by six soft skills (adaptability, curiosity, initiative, leadership, perseverance, and social awareness), alongside self-regulated learning strategies, academic motivation, achievement emotions, and fluid reasoning abilities, in students' performance on standardized arithmetic tasks. Data were gathered from 551 Italian students aged 11-18 through classroom-based paper-and-pencil tasks and questionnaires. Path analysis results reveal that only fluid reasoning abilities, academic motivation, and negative achievement emotions significantly correlate with arithmetic performance. Soft skills demonstrate an indirect relationship with arithmetic performance, mediated by negative achievement emotions and academic motivation (while not mediated by positive achievement emotions and self-regulated learning strategies). These findings underscore the increasingly recognized significance of soft skills and expand their relevance to arithmetic achievement, potentially suggesting novel psychoeducational interventions to bolster students' performance in this realm.},

  abstract={Background: About 9 million nurses will be needed by 2030. To face these unprecedented times, governments/institutions focus on educating as many nursing students as possible. This strategy is clouded by burnout and lack of both health and well-being among students and by the fact that personality is one of the major determinants of these health outcomes. Nevertheless, recent findings show that personality is a complex adaptive system (i,e., nonlinear) and that combinations of people's temperament and character traits (i.e., joint personality networks) might provide further information to understand its development, academic burnout, and lack of health and well-being. Aims: Our aims were to investigate the linear relationship between nursing students' personality, burnout, health, and well-being; investigate the linear mediational effects of personality and burnout on health and well-being; and investigate differences in these health outcomes between/ within students with distinct joint personality networks (i.e., nonlinear relationships). Method: Swedish nursing students (189 women, 29 men) responded to the Temperament and Character Inventory, The Maslach Burnout Inventory-General Survey for Students, and the Public Health Surveillance Well-Being Scale. We conducted correlation analyses and Structural Equation Modeling and, for the nonlinear relationships, Latent Profile Analysis and Latent Class Analysis for clustering and then Analyses of Variance for differences in health outcomes between/within students with distinct personality networks. This study was not pre-registered. Results: High levels of health and well-being and low burnout symptoms (low Emotional Exhaustion, low Cynicism, and high Academic Efficacy) were associated with low Harm Avoidance and high Self-Directedness. Some personality traits were associated with specific health outcomes (e.g., high Self-Transcendence-high Emotional Exhaustion and high Persistence-high Academic Efficacy) and their effects on health and well-being were mediated by specific burnout symptoms. Cynicism and Emotional Exhaustion predicted low levels of health and well-being, Academic Efficacy predicted high levels, and Cynicism lead both directly and indirectly to low levels of health and well-being through Emotional Exhaustion. We found two joint personality networks: students with an Organized/Reliable combination who reported being less emotionally exhausted by their studies, less cynical towards education, higher self-efficacy regarding their academic work/skills, and better health and well-being compared to nursing students with an Emotional/Unreliable combination. Conclusions: The coherence of temperament-character, rather than single traits, seems to determine students' health outcomes. Thus, nursing education might need to focus on helping students to develop professional skills and health-related abilities (e.g., self-acceptance and spiritualacceptance), by supporting self-awareness.},

  abstract={Background: Evidence consistently demonstrated that bullying victimization was associated with problematic behaviors among adolescents. However, scant attention has been given to simultaneous comparisons of the impacts of two distinct forms of victimization, traditional bullying victimization and cyberbullying victimization. In addition, the mechanisms underlying the relationship between bullying victimization and problem behavior remain inadequately explored. Objective: This study aimed to examine the correlation between bullying victimization and problematic behaviors, as well as the mediating roles of intrapersonal emotional competence and interpersonal social competence. Participants and setting: A sample of 26,450 adolescents with a mean age of 15.44 (SD = 0.56) across nine countries was derived from the Study on Social and Emotional Skills (SSES). Methods: Data analysis was conducted using structural equation modeling, c omprising three key components: the measurement model, the structural model, and the bootstrapping analysis for mediating effects. Results: Both traditional bullying and cyberbullying victimization exhibited positive correlations with problematic behaviors, with cyberbullying victimization demonstrating a stronger effect. The mediating effects of intrapersonal emotional competence and interpersonal social competence were observed in the correlation between bullying victimization and problematic behaviors. Conclusions: This study not only contributed to our comprehension of the underlying mechanisms connecting bullying victimization and adolescent problematic behaviors, but also holds significance for policy development and practice.},

To address this need, this study's primary purpose was the examination of a German translation of the assessment with a specific focus on measurement invariance and concurrent validity invariance testing with 821 3rd through 6th -grade students in Austria and Germany. Results indicated that the SELb+MHS items clustered into 2 SEL factors and 2 EBC factors. With regard to measurement invariance, the SELb+MHS functioned similarly across both Austria and Germany and full scalar invariance was achieved. Additionally, the overall pattern of concurrent validity relationships was as expected and similar across countries. Implications and future directions are discussed.},

Across two studies (N1 = 990, N2= 824) we developed the Italian version of the BESSI, provided further support for its convergent and discriminant validity with the Big Five, and expanded its nomological network to procrastination, self-efficacy, and emotion regulation. The BESSI-I showed excellent internal reliability and satisfactory fit indices at the facet, domain, and overarching framework level. We also confirmed the correlations between the SEB skills and the Big Five personality traits and found meaningful correlations with the selected external outcomes.

However, existing research has mostly focused on the consequences of socio-emotional skills, with less attention devoted to the role of school climate in the deployment of these skills. Aims: This study investigated the role of school climate in socio-emotional skills. More specifically, we investigated whether cooperative or competitive school climates are associated with students' socio-emotional skills. Sample: Our study utilized data from the OECD Survey on Social and Emotional Skills, collected from 10 cities across nine countries. Participants were 60,985 students, including 31,187 10-year-olds (49.70\% females) and 29,798 15-year-olds (51.6\% females). Methods: We conducted multilevel structural equation modelling to test whether cooperative and competitive climates were associated with socio-emotional skills. These skills include five broad domain skills and 15 more specific skills: task performance (self-control, responsibility and persistence), emotion regulation (stress resistance, emotional control and optimism), collaboration (empathy, trust and cooperation), open-mindedness (tolerance, curiosity and creativity) and engaging with others (sociability, assertiveness and energy). Results: Our findings indicated a positive relationship between a cooperative climate and socio-emotional skills. In contrast, the relationship between a competitive climate and socio-emotional skills was primarily negative. Conclusion: This study highlights the contrasting roles of cooperative and competitive climates in students' socio-emotional skills.},

  abstract={Despite cross-sectional evidence of significant associations between loneliness and the Big Five personality traits, elucidating the directionality of these associations requires further longitudinal investigation. To address this gap, the present study examined the longitudinal relationship between loneliness and personality traits, controlling for negative affect. Data were drawn from the Health and Retirement Study collected in 2012, 2016, and 2020 (N = 9671). The random intercept cross-lagged panel model was used, enabling the examination of withinperson associations. Results showed that loneliness predicted subsequent declines in extraversion, agreeableness, and conscientiousness. Furthermore, neuroticism was found to be a positive predictor of future loneliness, whereas the other personality traits were negative predictors. In addition, negative affect had bidirectional associations with neuroticism and predicted future loneliness. Overall, these results show that these variables are unidirectionally or bidirectionally linked at the within-person level. These findings also highlight the need for multifaceted interventions that include a range of approaches, such as promoting positive personality traits, managing negative affect, and enhancing social skills.},

  abstract={Mindreading ability-also referred to as cognitive empathy or mentalizing-is typically conceptualized as a relatively stable dimension of individual differences in the ability to make accurate inferences about the mental states of others. This construct is primarily assessed using self-report questionnaires and task-based performance measures. However, the validity of these measures has been questioned: According to rival interpretations, mindreading tasks may capture general cognitive ability, whereas mindreading self-reports may capture perceived rather than actual mindreading ability. In this preregistered multimethod study involving 700 participants from the U.S. general population, we tested the validity of mindreading measures by examining the nomological network of self-reports and task-based methods using structural equation modeling. Specifically, we contrasted the empirical associations with theoretical predictions that assume mindreading measures are valid versus invalid. More consistent with rival interpretations, mindreading tasks showed a negligible latent correlation with mindreading self-reports (.05) and a large one with general cognitive ability (.85), whereas mindreading self-reports were specifically associated with perceived performance in mindreading tasks (.29). Also more consistent with rival interpretations, neither mindreading self-reports nor task-based measures showed positive unique associations with psychosocial functioning when controlling for general cognitive ability and general positive self-evaluation. Instead, negative unique associations emerged for both methods, although this effect was not robust for tasks. Overall, the results cast doubt on the validity of commonly used mindreading measures and support their rival interpretations.},

  author={Grosz, Michael P. and van Aert, Robbie C. M. and Back, Mitja D.},
  language={English},
  abstract={Theories have proposed diverse reasons for why individual differences such as personality traits lead to social status attainment in face-to-face groups. We integrated these different theoretical standpoints into a model with four paths from individual differences to status: a dominance, a competence, a virtue, and a micropolitics path. To investigate these paths, we meta-analyzed over 100 years of research on bivariate associations of personality traits, cognitive abilities, and physical size with the attainment of status-related outcomes in face-to-face groups (1,064 effects from 276 samples including 56,153 participants). The status-related outcome variables were admiring respect, social influence, popularity (i.e., being liked by others), leadership emergence, and a mixture of outcome variables. The meta-analytic correlations we found were largely in line with the micropolitics path, tentatively in line with the competence and virtue paths, and only partly in line with the dominance path. These findings suggest that status attainment depends not only on the competence and virtue of an individual but also on how individuals can enhance their apparent competence or virtue by behaving assertively, by being extraverted, or through self-monitoring. We also investigated how the relations between individual differences and status-related outcomes were moderated by kind of status-related outcome, nature of the group task, culture (collectivism/individualism), and length of acquaintance. The moderation analysis yielded mixed and inconclusive results. The review ends with directions for research, such as the need to separately assess and study the different status-related outcomes. Public Significance Statement This meta-analysis investigated who attains social status in face-to-face groups. Social status was frequently attained not only by competent and virtuous individuals but also by individuals who enhanced their appearance of competence or virtue by behaving in assertive, extraverted, and socially appropriate ways. These findings underline the need to not take competence or virtue of those high in social status for granted and to implement evidence-based selection procedures when it comes to deciding whom to put into superordinate social positions.},

  abstract={Social, emotional, and behavioral (SEB) skills encompass a broad range of interpersonal and intrapersonal abilities that are crucial for establishing and maintaining relationships, managing emotions, setting and pursuing goals, and exploring new learning opportunities. To address the lack of consensus regarding terminology, definition, and assessment of SEB skills, Soto et al. developed the Behavioral, Emotional, and Social Skills Inventory (BESSI), which consists of 192 items, 32 facets, and 5 domains. The objective of the current study was to adapt the BESSI to Spanish (referred to as BESSI-Sp) and enhance the overall understanding of the BESSI framework. A sample of 303 people was employed with a mean age of 30.35 years (SD = 14.73), ranging from 18 to 85 years. The results indicate that the BESSI-Sp demonstrates strong psychometric properties. Its facet- and domain-level structure aligns with the theoretical expectations and closely resembles the English-language source version. The facets exhibit high reliability (mean omega = .89), and the scores demonstrate adequate stability after 3 to 4 weeks (mean rICC = .77). The BESSI-Sp also displays evidence of convergent validity and integrates well with the Big Five framework, providing incremental validity for various outcomes. We discuss the implications of these findings for the assessment of SEB skills and future research in this field.},

However, little is known about the physical activity or sports involvement of excluded young people or the role of participation on predictors and outcomes associated with exclusion.AimsThe study aimed to understand (i) how active excluded young people are, (ii) whether predictors of school exclusion are influenced by participation in physical activity or sport and (iii) if physical activity or sports participation moderates the relationship between school exclusion and health, behavioural and educational outcomes.MethodsMillennium Cohort Study Wave 6 data were analysed using linear multiple regression models. Participants were 11,066 young people. Dependent variables were physical activity or sports participation. Independent variables included school exclusion, body composition and physical health, cognitive and educational outcomes, crime, anti-social and harmful behaviours, mental health and individual demographic predictors.ResultsMultiple regression analysis of Millennium Cohort Study Wave 6 data indicates young people excluded from education participate in more (+20.71 +/- 9.72, p = .03) minutes of physical activity but less (-22.38 +/- 32.52, p = .49) minutes of sport than non-excluded participants. Physical activity or sport did not influence predictors or outcomes associated with exclusion.ConclusionFindings indicate young people excluded from education participate in 8\% more MVPA, but 13\% less sport than peers not excluded from education.

In this investigation, we tested whether the ability to regulate one's own emotions and the ability to regulate other's emotions are related. We assessed regulators' self-oriented emotion regulation ability by measuring their own emotional experiences in a self-oriented emotion regulation task. We assessed regulators' other-oriented emotion regulation ability by measuring the emotional experiences of their targets in an other-oriented emotion regulation task. We found that self-oriented and other-oriented emotion regulation abilities were not significantly related. However, people were better able to regulate targets who were better at regulating themselves. People who frequently used self-oriented emotion regulation strategies (e.g., distraction) had greater self-oriented, but not other-oriented, emotion regulation ability. People with greater self-oriented emotion regulation ability made themselves feel less unpleasant emotions upon regulating their emotions. People with greater other-oriented emotion regulation ability made both the target of regulation and themselves feel less unpleasant emotions upon regulating the target's emotions. The target and regulator also felt closer to one another when the regulator had greater other-oriented emotion regulation ability. These findings suggest that the ability to regulate the emotions of others might be linked to desirable personal and social outcomes, even in interactions among strangers.},

In this study (N = 642), we examined whether subscales of the Behavioral, Emotional, and Social Skills Inventory (BESSI), a measure of SEB skills, provided incremental validity in the prediction of the ACT composite score, an important academic outcome for American adolescents, over the Big Five personality traits. Consistent with our expectations, on average, SEB skills showed stronger associations with ACT achievement scores than personality traits. Moreover, SEB skills added incremental validity over and above personality traits in predicting ACT achievement scores.

  abstract={Social skills (e.g., assertiveness, empathy, ability to accept criticism) are essential for the medical profession and therefore also for the selection and development of medical students. However, the term ``social skills{''} is understood differently in different contexts. There is no agreed upon taxonomy for classifying physicians' social skills, and skills with the same meaning often have different names. This conceptual ambiguity presents a hurdle to cross-context communication and to the development of methods to assess social skills. Drawing from behavioral psychology, we aim to contribute to a better understanding of social skills in the medical context. To this end, we introduce a theoretically and empirically informed taxonomy that can be used to integrate the large number of different social skills. We consider how skills manifest at the behavioral level to ensure that we focus only on skills that are actually observable, distinguishable, and measurable. Here, behavioral research has shown that three overarching skill dimensions can be seen in interpersonal situations and are clearly distinguishable from each other: agency skill (i.e., getting ahead in social situations), communion skill (i.e., getting along in social situations), and interpersonal resilience (i.e., staying calm in social situations). We show that almost all social skills relevant for physicians fit into this structure. The approach presented allows redundant descriptions to be combined under three clearly distinguishable and behavior based dimensions of social skills. This approach has implications for the assessment of social skills in both the selection and development of students.},

In contrast, Personality Functioning (Criterion A) cannot be distinguished from personality traits, lacks both discriminant and incremental validity, and has a shaky theoretical background. We offer some suggestions with a view to the future. These include removing Criterion A, using the real-life consequences of traits as indicators of severity, delving into the dynamic mechanisms underlying traits, and furthering the integration of currently disengaged psychological paradigms that can shape a sounder clinical science.},

  abstract={The teaching profession is characterised by high levels of stress and numerous emotional challenges, especially in the early stages of a career. Previous research suggests that teachers' social and emotional competencies (SEC) are related to their occupational well-being as they influence the way they cope with everyday emotional challenges at work. This points to the role of SEC as potential psychological resources that can mitigate negative outcomes such as burnout and leaving the profession among teachers in the early stages of their career. However, research in this area is still scarce and it is unclear how certain SEC are related to different aspects of occupational well-being and commitment to the teaching profession. The aim of this paper is to review conceptual frameworks of SEC and existing research in the field, discuss the role they play in education and compare them with related constructs in the domain of individual differences. Furthermore, it will provide an overview of research on teachers' occupational well-being and examine the relevance of teachers' SEC for outcomes such as burnout, work engagement, and job satisfaction. The paper will conclude by examining methodological aspects of SEC assessment and review challenges and directions for future research.},

  abstract={Background: The salience of perceived academic competence has been long understood in educational research. Research is now revealing the salience of perceived social-emotional competence (perceived-SEC; i.e., the sense of being capable in one's social-emotional interactions). However, more research is needed to extend understanding of factors associated with perceived-SEC. Aims: Guided by the Social and Emotional Competence School Model, we investigated students' perceived-SEC. We examined the extent to which students' perceptions of autonomy-supportive teaching are linked with perceived-SEC and, in turn, students' well-being (student-reported positive and negative affect), social-emotional skills (parent-reported cognitive reappraisal and self-reflection), and behavioral outcomes (parent-reported prosocial behavior and conduct problems). Sample: The sample comprised 501 Australian students (and their parents/carers). Methods: Using bifactor exploratory structural equation modelling, five dimensions of perceived-SEC (for assertiveness, tolerance, social regulation, emotion regulation, and emotional awareness) were examined via a global factor and as specific factors. Then, structural equation modelling was used to examine associations among all variables. Results: Perceived autonomy-support was associated with global perceived-SEC. In turn, global perceived-SEC was associated with all outcomes. Three specific perceived-SEC factors also had unique associations with outcomes (beyond the role of the global factor): perceived competence for tolerance (linked with the two behaviors), emotional regulation (linked with negative affect and the two social-emotional skills), and emotional awareness (linked with self-reflection). Conclusions: Findings yield knowledge about perceived-SEC and hold implications for understanding and supporting students' well-being, social-emotional skills, and behavioral outcomes.},

  abstract={Teacher personality has been recognized as an important factor in predicting job-related outcomes such as burnout, job performance, or motivation. Although personality facets can better predict various outcomes than domains, research on teacher personality at the facet level is still scarce. Thus, the aim of this study was to examine the associations between teacher personality domains and incremental facets and indicators of teachers' job-related outcomes (i.e., job satisfaction, emotional exhaustion, turnover intentions, self-efficacy). Data from 1137 secondary school teachers was collected at two time points. To decompose the variance in personality items into unique domain and facets parts while simultaneously controlling for the response style method factor and the measurement error, the domain-incremental facet-acquiescence bifactor (DIFAB) model was tested. The results showed that incremental facets explained variance in analyzed job-related outcomes beyond the domains, but the amount of the explained variance differed across the criteria.},

  abstract={Meta-analytic evidence shows that most personality traits tend to increase through early adulthood and middle age but decrease in late adulthood, whereas Emotional Stability continues to increase throughout late adulthood. We propose that these normative patterns of personality development can be explained by motivational theories of aging. Specifically, decreases in Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, and Openness to Experience may reflect a reduced capacity to control one's environment, whereas continued increases in Emotional Stability reflect increases in individual's ability to compensate and cope with age-graded losses. Pairing motivational theories of aging with longitudinal evidence in personality science provides an explanation for empirical patterns of personality trait development and raises interesting possibilities to promote healthy aging.},

  abstract={Passion is stereotypically expressed through animated facial expressions, energetic body movements, varied tone, and pitch-and met with interpersonal benefits. However, these capture only a subset of passion expressions that are more common for extraverts. Indeed, in an initial dyadic study of supervisors and their subordinates (N = 330), extraverts expressed their passion more strongly through these stereotypical expressions of passion, and observers perceived extraverts as more passionate than introverts. Across three studies (Ntotal = 1,373), we subsequently developed a more comprehensive passion expressions and behaviors scale (PEBS). Using this measure in a daily diary study (N = 206, k = 1,862), we found that extraverts not only expressed their passion in more stereotypical ways, but through a broader variety of expressions in general. Extraverts are perceived as more passionate because they have a broader behavioral repertoire, express their passion more frequently and diversely, and thereby attain greater interpersonal rewards.},

This case study explored how, when asked to foster social and emotional learning within their schools, 16 SEL teachers created learning opportunities for students to bolster their social and emotional skills. Teachers were asked to first define SEL and then to create portfolios showcasing three of their SEL lessons or initiatives. Content analysis of definitions revealed that teachers largely defined SEL as fostering students' self-awareness and self -management. Content analysis of each of the teachers' lessons indicated that the learning opportunities or initiatives that teachers introduced were predominantly social in nature and oftentimes focused on having students practice emotion regulation strategies. Findings inform our understanding of the perceptions and actualizations of SEL in applied contexts.},

The Chinese versions of the Delaware Social and Emotional Competency Scale, Teacher-student Relationship Scale, Peer-nomination method and Academic Achievement Tests were used to measure students' SEC, teacher-student relationships, peer relationships (including social preference (SP) and social impact (SI)) and academic achievements, respectively. In total, 3995 fourth-grade students participated in the first survey, and 2789 of them were tracked in the follow-up survey two years later. Structural equation modelling was employed to investigate the cross-lagged relationships among the variables across time. The results showed the reciprocal associations between SEC with academic achievements and teacher-student relationships, as well as between academic achievements with SP and teacher-student relationships. Moreover, variations in these reciprocal associations were observed across the subjects of reading, mathematics and science. In summary, this study offers new insights for enhancing students' SEC, interpersonal relationships and academic achievements, and implications for future subject-specific education can be derived by considering the complex interplay in the subjects of reading, mathematics and science.},

  abstract={Introduction. Social and emotional (SE) skills are known to be linked to important life outcomes, many of which fall into the academic domain. For example, meta-analytic data show that the skill of Sustaining Effort is nearly or just as important for academic performance as intelligence. In a recent study with long-term tracking of high school students, those who came from schools with a strong emphasis on SE skill development were more likely to enroll in college within two years of high school graduation. Longitudinal studies like this one are rare, however. Method. The focus of the present study is on the SE skills of 6662 students assessed during high school and their relationship with high school academic performance, standardized college admissions test performance, and ultimately postsecondary enrollment and retention. Results. We examined mean-level differences in household income, high school GPA, ACT Composite scores, and SE skills by college enrollment and retention status and found several significant differences, often favoring the enrolled or retained group. Moreover, we found support for the incremental validity of SE skills as they predicted enrollment and retention above household income, high school GPA, and ACT scores. Discussion. Understanding SE skills' effects on later academic outcomes is important to help inform early SE skill intervention and development efforts in secondary and postsecondary settings. Additional implications and future directions are discussed.},

  abstract={Social-emotional competence (SEC) is a multidimensional construct involving diverse skills and mindsets contributing to intrapersonal and interpersonal well-being. Despite increasing efforts to promote youth SEC worldwide, the existing SEC measurements are largely based on frameworks and evidence originating from Western societies, questioning the applicability of prevalent SEC measurement models to non-Western contexts. This study aims to compare a measurement model of SEC between East Asian (EA) and North American (NA) countries. This study analyzed youth self-reports from the 2018 OECD Survey on Social and Emotional Skills (SSES; N = 25,454, age 10 and 15) from two countries in EA (China and South Korea) and two countries in NA (Canada and USA). Based on the Big Five personality model, the SSES was designed to measure five dimensions and 15 sub-constructs of SEC using 100 Likert-type items. Using a network psychometrics method called Exploratory Graph Analysis, we uncovered and compared the underlying structure of the multidimensional construct of youth SEC between EA and NA samples. The findings suggest that the SSES measurement model is largely comparable across two cultures, with some noteworthy differences. The commonly identified dimensions of SEC were: (1) Emotional Control, (2) Optimism, (3) Task Performance, (4) Open-mindedness, (5) Prosociality, and (6) Leadership. The differences observed in the structure of dimensions and sub-constructs are discussed. This study contributes to ongoing efforts to develop and enhance international SEC assessments that are cross-culturally applicable and comparable.},

We address three ``misconceptions{''} about personality psychology that are surprisingly pervasive outside of that field: that there are personality types, that personality is fixed, and that the existence of personality implies that situations are unimportant. We then cover four ways that personality psychology can assist educational aims: personality can be used to (1) boost our ability to accurately predict educational outcomes, (2) inform educational interventions, (3) support the academic development of all learners in personalised learning interventions, and (4) be employed as target outcomes for education. In the process, we show how personality relates to important educational outcomes, outline theoretical links with educationally relevant concepts like socio-emotional skills, and include an overview of current personality scales that can be used when getting started. Through this paper, we hope to stimulate and enthuse researchers to advance synthesis between the disciplines.},

  abstract={School achievement has long-term consequences for occupational success, mental health, and overall psychological adjustment. The present study examined the association between temperament trajectories from late childhood through adolescence and academic outcomes during late adolescence and young adulthood. Data come from the California Families Project, a longitudinal study of 674 Mexican-origin youth assessed 12 times from Age 10 to 23, and from school records. Results from latent growth curve models indicate that higher levels of Effortful Control (EC) at Age 10 were associated with better academic achievement (i.e., higher high school grade point average and test scores, greater likelihood of high school graduation and college attendance) in late adolescence and young adulthood. Higher levels of Negative Emotionality (NEM) at Age 10 were associated with worse academic achievement, but this effect did not hold for all facets of NEM. Neither the levels nor slopes of Positive Emotionality (Surgency, Affiliation) consistently predicted school achievement. There were no main effects of the EC or NEM slopes; however, statistically significant interactions between these slopes and parental monitoring emerged. When parental monitoring was low, youth who experienced greater increases in EC (vs. flat or decreasing slopes) had better academic achievement, and youth who experienced greater increases in NEM had worse academic achievement; in contrast, when parents closely monitored their children, changes in EC and NEM were only weakly associated with achievement. Overall, these findings demonstrate that temperament in late childhood, and changes in temperament across adolescence, have important prospective effects on academic achievement.},

A multicomponent SES composite was used to assess the degree of socioeconomic disadvantage (DSD). Results from a hierarchical regression analysis showed that after accounting for demographic variables, both PLU and DED were significant factors on applicants' Casper performance. Bilingualism was associated with better Casper performance compared to English monolinguals and ESL students. No significant effect of speaking English as a native language was found on applicants' Casper performance. English monolinguals and ESL students performed equivalently on Casper. Finally, high DSD was associated with better Casper performance than low DSD, and the impact of DSD on Casper held the same across all four language groups. These findings provide evidence that socio-cultural factors, such as PLU and DSD have important impacts on SJT performance. Further research is needed to understand the role of differences in language construction across socio-cultural factors on constructed-response SJT performance.},

This article posits that the temporality of unobserved mediated effects are integral to our understanding of the pathways underlying ECE programs' long-term impacts. Leveraging panel data, we examined the patterns of indirect effects from two ECE programs on educational attainment via bundled mediators measured at age 8 or 10, 12, and 15 (the Abecedarian Project: N =107; 97\% Black; 3\% White; 52\% girls. Head Start: N = 1,251; 44\% Black; 25\% Hispanic; 31\% White; 50\% girls). Accounting for up to 50\% of the impact, indirect effects in both studies revealed stable patterns of direct effects, suggesting that impacts on unmeasured mediators were present throughout the duration of the period after the end of ECE programs and before later outcomes were observed. These findings indicate that some of the mechanisms involved in Abecedarian's and Head Start's long-term impacts were substantial and independent from those typically captured by commonly used measures of cognitive and socioemotional or behavioral skills, which points to the need for new approaches to studying child-environment transactions.},

  abstract={Individuals use social, emotional, and behavioral (SEB) skills to build and maintain social relationships, regulate emotions, and manage goal-directed behaviors. A promising integrative framework of SEB skills was recently proposed, showing that they matter for positive outcomes during adolescence. Nothing is known about how and whether they differ between 12 and 19 years old and whether such differences depend on gender (males or females). Uncovering their age trajectories is fundamental because SEB skills are highly needed during this period of life. Educators, psychologists, and policymakers need to understand when, why, and how interventions concerning SEB skills should be proposed, potentially considering male and female profiles. To cover this gap, we cross-sectionally analyzed data from 4106 participants (2215 females, 12-19 years old). We highlighted age and gender differences in the five domains of SEB skills (self-management, innovation, cooperation, social engagement, and emotional resilience). Our results show that each SEB skill follows a specific age trend: emotional resilience and cooperation skills increase naturally between 12 and 19 years old, while innovation, social engagement, and self-management skills decline, especially between 12 and 16 years old, and grow later. The trajectories of self-management, social engagement, and emotional resilience skills also differ between males and females. Importantly, we detected declines in SEB skills (especially for social engagement and innovation skills) that can inform policies and interventions to sustain SEB skills in youths to favor their well-being and success in this crucial period.},

Building upon previous research and theories, such as Hilgard's ``Trilogy of Mind{''}, the generic skill components approach aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the structure and composition of any skill, whether hard or soft. By examining these components and their interactions, we can gain a more in-depth understanding of the nature of skills and their development.

Life events, such as marriage, becoming a parent, and retirement, have been proposed as facilitating personality growth via the adoption of novel social roles. However, empirical evidence linking life events with personality development is sparse. Most studies have relied on few assessments separated by long time intervals and have focused on a single life event. In contrast, the content of life is composed of small, recurrent experiences (e.g., getting sick or practicing a hobby), with relatively few major events (e.g., childbirth). Small, frequently experienced life events may play an important and overlooked role in personality development.Method: The present study examined the extent to which 25 major and minor life events alter the trajectory of personality development in a large, frequently assessed sample (N-sample = 4904, N-assessments = 47,814, median retest interval = 35 days).Results: Using a flexible analytic strategy to accommodate the repeated occurrence of life events, we found that the trajectory of personality development shifted in response to a single occurrence of some major life events (e.g., divorce), and recurrent, ``minor{''} life experiences (e.g., one's partner doing something special).Conclusion: Both stark role changes and frequently reinforced minor experiences can lead to personality change.},

  abstract={There is a wealth of evidence justifying the use of personality assessments for selection. Nonetheless, some reluctance to use these assessments stems from their perceived vulnerability to response distortion (i.e., faking) and the somewhat negative applicant reactions they elicit, when compared to other assessments. Adopting a forced-choice personality assessment format appears to alleviate the former problem but exacerbates the latter. In this study, we introduce basic psychological needs as a theoretical foundation to develop interventions to improve reactions to forced-choice personality assessments. We propose that the forced-choice format impedes respondents' desire to respond to items in a preferred way, interfering with autonomy need satisfaction, and constrains respondents' opportunity to show their capabilities, interfering with competence need satisfaction. In this pre-registered between-subjects experiment (N = 1565), we investigated two modifications to a ranked forced-choice personality questionnaire and compared these to traditional forced-choice and single-stimulus (Likert) formatted questionnaires. One modification, where participants could write a free-text response following the assessment, did not show significant effects on reactions. The second modification allowed participants to view all items they had ranked last (first) and then identify any the participant believed in fact described them well (poorly). That modification positively affected perceived autonomy- and competence-support, and fairness perceptions, bridging approximately half of the gap between reactions to forced-choice and single-stimulus assessment formats. This study suggests that a modification to forced-choice personality questionnaires may improve applicant reactions and that basic psychological needs theory may be a fruitful lens through which to further understand reactions to assessments.},

A critical resource for individuals to be adaptive are broad skills relevant to varied organizational conditions. These adaptive skills have been discussed in diverse venues but rarely in the organizational literature. Also, most, if not all, of extant conceptual frameworks related to adaptive skills remain unvalidated. The purpose of this research was to organize these skills, define and situate them in the relevant organizational and psychological literatures, and empirically test a proposed four-category framework. The experimental results supported the C+MAC framework, as skills were better categorized in terms of their theoretically related category. Additionally, the four-category framework proved a better fit to the skills compared to an influential, alternative model. The findings' implications are discussed, noting how an empirically validated framework can facilitate understanding of how individuals engage with organizational environments and organizations get their work done.},

  abstract={The Social Shapes Test (SST) is a measure of social intelligence which does not use human faces or rely on extensive verbal ability. The SST has shown promising validity among adults without autism spectrum disorder (ASD), but it is uncertain whether it is suitable for adults with ASD. We find measurement invariance between adults with (n = 229) or without ASD (n = 1,049) on the 23-item SST. We also find that adults without ASD score higher on the SST than adults with ASD (d = 0.21). We also provide two, 14-item versions which demonstrated good parallel test-retest reliability and are positively related to scores on the Frith-Happe task. The SST is suitable for remote, online research studies.},

  abstract={Soft skills are the key characteristics for students' success and wellbeing in the 21st century, but they were only rarely studied contemporarily or integrated into comprehensive models of self-regulated learning. This makes it difficult to understand the role that specific skills have above and beyond the others and how they work together to favor students' achievement and life satisfaction. For this reason, in a sample of 585 students (10-18 years old), we applied an exploratory network analysis and studied three crucial soft skills (i.e., adaptability, curiosity, and perseverance) and their contemporary network of inter-relationships with a host of functional study-related factors, including self-regulated learning strategies, motivation, emotions, cognitive abilities, academic achievement, and life and school satisfaction. Results show that the three soft skills play a positive role within the school context through their association with the majority of the study-related factors that mediate their relationships with academic achievement. Importantly, the results differentiated adaptability (which mainly relates with wellbeing and emotional variables), perseverance (which relates with the cognitive and behavioral aspect of learning), and curiosity (which bridges the connection between the other skills and relates with emotional and behavioral variables) in the school context. Overall, these findings contribute to the deepening of the theoretical framework on soft skills and their role as part of a successful learning profile, and inform us about the possible effectiveness of intervention on soft skills for students' achievement and wellbeing.},

We assessed eight SEB skills at the onset of a volunteering program, and students' volunteer hours were assessed 10-weeks later. Approximately 41.5\% of the sample did not complete any volunteer hours. Higher levels of perspective taking skill, abstract thinking skill, and stress regulation were associated with more time spent volunteering.

  abstract={Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a heterogeneous condition that is particularly associated with three broad personality dimensions: neuroticism (i.e., high negative affectivity), agreeableness (i.e., low antagonism), and conscientiousness (i.e., low disinhibition). The purpose of the present study was to explore whether treatment with BPD Compass, a novel personality-based intervention for BPD, results in greater reductions in BPD symptoms, neuroticism, agreeableness, and conscientiousness compared to a waitlist control (WLC) condition. We also aimed to characterize within-treatment effects for participants assigned to the BPD Compass condition and evaluate patients' satisfaction with treatment. Participants (N = 51; M-age = 28.38; 83.3\% female; 93.8\% White; 54.2\% sexual minority) meeting DSM-5 criteria for BPD were enrolled in a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of BPD Compass. Patients were randomly assigned to receive 18 sessions of BPD Compass or complete an 18-week waiting period. BPD Compass led to larger reductions in BPD symptoms (assessor-rated {[}beta = -0.47] and self-reported {[}beta = -0.62]) and neuroticism (beta = -0.37), but not agreeableness (beta = 0.08) or conscientiousness (beta = 0.10), compared to the WLC condition. Within the BPD Compass condition, pre- to posttreatment improvements in BPD symptoms, neuroticism, and conscientiousness were significant and large in magnitude (Hedges' gs: -1.38 to -1.08). Patients were highly satisfied with BPD Compass and generally perceived it to be an appropriate length. Thus, BPD Compass may be an accessible and useful complement to more specialty or intensive treatments for BPD.},

  abstract={Introduction/objective: Socio-emotional competencies are skills that mediate be-tween emotional management and social adjustment. These skills are relevant for: learn-ing, professional performance, mental health, and well-being. The objective is to analyze the psychometric properties of the Social and emotional Competencies Questionnaire SEC-Q in Chilean university students. Method: The sample included 699 university students, 493 women and 206 men. The internal structure was analyzed through cross validation, an exploratory and confirmatory factorial analysis. Convergent and discriminant validity were determined using the Pearson correlation coefficient between the subscales of the SEC-Q with the Scale of Perceived Self-Efficacy Specific to Academic Situations, Life Satisfaction and Maslach Burnout Inventory. Results: adequate psychometric properties in the questionnaire, observing the four components proposed by the structure of the original instrument -self-awareness, self-man-agement, social awareness and decision-making. These competencies showed, as expected, a positive relationship with self-efficacy and life satisfaction, and an inverse relationship with stress. Also, social awareness presented differences according to gender, being higher in wom-en than in men. Conclusion: The SEC-Q is a reliable and valid instrument for the evaluation of Chilean university students.(c) 2023 Fundacion Universitaria Konrad Lorenz.

  abstract={The study of emotional intelligence (EI) in the field of leadership, and in the organizational sciences in general, has often been characterized by controversy and criticism. But the study of EI has nonetheless persisted by developing new measures and models to address these concerns. In a prior letter exchange by Antonakis, Ashkanasy, and Dasborough (2009), two author teams debated the role of EI in the leadership literature, but also set an agenda for research and reconciliation for the future. The present exchange revisits these arguments using evidence accumulated over the past decade. Specifically, the authors debate not only the evidence for the predictive power of EI for workplace outcomes, but also the validity of EI as a construct, the measurement of EI, and the appropriateness of analytical tests for establishing the value of EI. Although the author teams agree on the value of the study of emotions and the need for rigorous research in this area, they nonetheless propose alternative agendas and priorities for the future. Further, they conclude that the issues identified in this exchange are not unique to the study of EI; but should also serve to inform the study of other personality factors and leadership more broadly.},

As it continues to be elevated in educational discourse, it becomes increasingly clear that it is important to have reliable, validated measures of students' SE skills. Here we argue that framework and design are additional important considerations for the development and selection of SE skill assessments. We report the reliability and validity evidence for The Mosaic (TM) by ACT (R) Social Emotional Learning Assessment, an assessment designed to measure SE skills in middle and high school students that makes use of a research-based framework (the Big Five) and a multi-method approach (three item types including Likert, forced choice, and situational judgment tests). Here, we provide the results from data collected from more than 33,000 students who completed the assessment and for whom we have data on various outcome measures. We examined the validity evidence for the individual item types and the aggregate scores based on those three. Our findings support the contribution of multi-method assessment and an aggregate score. We discuss the ways the field can benefit from this or similarly designed assessments and discuss how the assessment results can be used by practitioners to promote programs aimed at stimulating students' personal growth.},

Here, we introduce a method to extract adjective similarities from language models as done with survey-based ratings in traditional psycholexical studies but using millions of times more text in a natural setting. The correlational structure produced through this method is highly similar to that of self- and other-ratings of 435 English terms reported by Saucier and Goldberg (1996a). The first three unrotated factors produced using NLP are congruent with those in survey data, with coefficients of 0.89, 0.79, and 0.79. This structure is robust to many modeling decisions: adjective set, including those with 1,710 (Goldberg. 1982) and 18,000 English terms (Allport \& Odbert, 1936); the query used to extract correlations; and language model. Notably, 4 Neuroticism and Openness are only weakly and inconsistently recovered. This is a new source of signal that is closer to the original (semantic) vision of the lexical hypothesis. The method can be applied where surveys cannot: in dozens of languages simultaneously, with tens of thousands of items, on historical text, and at extremely large scale for little cost. The code is made public to facilitate reproduction and fast iteration in new directions of research.},

  abstract={Positive youth development (PYD) has gained considerable traction among researchers and practitioners in promoting adolescent well-being and mental health. Several models have also been proposed in conceptualizing and measuring PYD, almost all of which were developed in individualistic and Western contexts. The abundance of overlapping PYD indicators from different models poses a challenge in further expanding the applicability of PYD in diverse cultural settings. Based on a review of major PYD paradigms (i.e., Five/Six/7 Cs model, 15 PYD constructs, and the 40 developmental assets framework), we propose an integrative paradigm of PYD, which organizes the different indicators of adolescent thriving into three clusters: (a) intrapersonal-immediate, (b) interpersonal-proximal, and (c) ecological-distal indicators. Building on prior empirically supported models of PYD, this paradigm aims to provide a common and unifying taxonomy among developmental scientists in conceptualizing and measuring adolescent thriving without neglecting the specificity of adolescent development in various ecologies. Future directions for PYD researchers, practitioners, and policymakers to advance the field are discussed.},

Results from a diverse sample of high school students (N = 897) indicate that SEB skills converge with the Big Five traits and CASEL competencies in expected and conceptually meaningful ways. Analyses of self-reported and school-reported outcomes extend SEB skills' nomological network by showing that they predict academic achievement and engagement, occupational interests, social relationships, civic engagement, and well-being. Finally, tests of incremental validity indicate that SEB skills provide unique information beyond personality traits and that this information matters for predicting outcomes during adolescence. These findings advance our understanding of the nature, correlates, and consequences of SEB skills.},

  abstract={Social skills are of key importance in everyday and work life. However, the way in which they are typically assessed via self-report questionnaires has one potential downside; self-reports assess individuals' global self-concepts, which do not necessarily reflect individuals' actual social behaviors. In this research, we aimed to investigate how self-concepts assessed via questionnaires relate to skill expression assessed via behavioral observations after short interpersonal simulations. For this, we used an alternative behavior-based skill assessment approach designed to capture expressions of predefined social skills. Self- and observer ratings were collected to assess three different social skills: agency (i.e., getting ahead in social situations), communion (i.e., getting along in social situations), and interpersonal resilience (i.e., staying calm in social situations). We explored how these skills were related to self-concepts by differentiating between a classic personality measure (i.e., Big Five Inventory 2; BFI-2) and a novel skill questionnaire (i.e., Behavioral, Emotional, and Social Skills Inventory; BESSI). The results (N = 137) showed that both personality and skill self-concepts predicted self-rated skill expression, with the BESSI showing incremental validity. For both personality and skills self-concepts, the relationships with observer-rated skill expression were significant for agency but not for communion or interpersonal resilience. We discuss these results and highlight the theoretical and practical importance of differentiating between skill self-concepts and actual skill expression.},

Toward an improved SEB skill assessment, Soto and colleagues recently introduced the Behavioral, Emotional, and Social Skills Inventory (BESSI). Measuring 32 facets from 5 domains with 192 items (assessment duration: similar to 15 min), BESSI constitutes the most extensive SEB inventory to date. However, so far, BESSI exists only in English. In three studies, we comprehensively validated a novel German-language adaptation, BESSI-G. Moreover, we expanded evidence on BESSI in three ways by (1) assessing the psychometric properties of the 32 individual skill facets, in addition to their domain-level structure; (2) providing first insights into the temporal stabilities of the 32 facets over 1.5 and 8 months; and (3) investigating the domains' and facets' associations with intelligence, in addition to personality traits. Results show that BESSI-G exhibits good psychometric properties (unidimensionality, reliability, factorial validity). Its domain-level structure is highly similar to that of the English-language source version. The facets show high temporal stabilities, convergent validity with personality traits, and discriminant validity with fluid and crystallized intelligence.

  abstract={Background Given the gendering of engineering roles and competencies, the evidence that the skills required for engineering management are widely referred to as social, and the fact that men engineers are stereotyped as more technical, and women as more social, it might be theorized that (a) those that occupy managerial (vs. technical) roles in engineering are more socially oriented, and (b) that this will especially be the case for women. However, no research has empirically tested the relationship between having socially oriented characteristics and being in managerial roles within the engineering profession, nor have gender differences been examined. Purpose We test whether social interests and communal goal strivings are linked to engineers' positioning in managerial roles and explore gender as a moderator of these relationships. Additionally, because enterprising interests and agentic goal strivings have been linked to managerial roles in other occupations, we test these as additional predictors of engineers' positioning in managerial roles. Method In a field survey of 274 industry engineers from multiple organizations and subfields, we tested the relationships described using hierarchical linear regression analysis. Results Enterprising interests and agentic goals, but not social interests and communal goals, were associated with being in managerial roles, and there were no gender differences in these relationships. Conclusions Our findings challenge perceptions that managerial roles in engineering, and particularly women's positioning in these roles, are associated with socially oriented tendencies. Findings have implications for research on gender stereotyping and intraoccupational gender segregation in engineering and hold educational implications for curriculum, instruction, and advising.},

Although this overview is undoubtedly informative and helpful, it offers little guidance on both certain weaknesses of Criterion A and research gaps and needs. A structural reason for this could be that the scientific field is divided into 2 camps with respect to Criterion A: Some authors focus mainly on confirmatory results and want to defend Criterion A in its current form, whereas others take the same results as an opportunity to call for its abolition. In this situation, there is little room for a nuanced and constructive discussion of the empirical and conceptual strengths and weaknesses of Criterion A. In this commentary, I use 2 examples to illustrate what research aimed at revising Criterion A might look like. From an empirical point of view, studies that take into account the peculiarities of the latent structure of the Level of Personality Functioning Scale are important because they can reveal local misspecification and challenges for the assessment of single cases. From a conceptual point of view, a more consistent definition of Criterion A in terms of impairments in ``capacities{''} could allow for a more coherent distinction from maladaptive ``traits.{''} This commentary hopes to strengthen a discourse that moves beyond the alternatives of defense or abolition toward the concrete improvement of Criterion A.},

To address these limitations, this study used a multi-informant (self, teacher, and parent) and multicohort (ages 10-15 from Finland, N = 5,533) perspective to study the association between 15 social-emotional skills and 20 educational (e.g., school grades), social (e.g., relationships with teachers), psychological health (e.g., life satisfaction), and physical health outcomes (e.g., sleep trouble). Results showed that (a) there was a modest level of interrater agreement on social-emotional skills, with the highest agreement between students and parents (mean r = .41); (b) inclusion of multi-informant ratings substantially enhanced the ability of social-emotional skills in predicting outcome variables, with parent- and self-rated skills playing important, unique roles; (c) by modeling skills at the facet level rather than at the domain level, we identified the key skills for different outcomes and found significant variation in facets' predictive utility even within the same domain; and (d) although the older cohort showed lower levels of most social-emotional skills (9/15), there were only minor changes in the interrater agreement and predictive utility on outcomes. Overall, self-control, trust, optimism, and energy were found among the four most important skills for academic and life success.

This is surprising because a better understanding of assessees' behaviors may provide the missing link between research on the determinants of assessee performance and research on the validity of performance ratings. Therefore, this study draws on behavioral personality science to scrutinize the behaviors that assessees express in interpersonal AC exercises. Our goals were to investigate (a) the structure of interpersonal behaviors, (b) the consistency of these behaviors across AC exercises, and (c) their effectiveness. We obtained videotaped performances of 203 assessees who took part in AC role-plays in a high-stakes context. Apart from assessors' performance ratings, trained experts also independently coded assessees on over 40 specific behavioral cues in these role-plays (e.g., clear statements, upright posture, freezing). Results were threefold: First, the structure underlying behavioral differences in interpersonal AC exercises was represented by four broad behavioral constructs: agency, communion, interpersonal calmness, and intellectual competence. Second, assessees' behaviors showed more consistency across exercises than performance ratings did. Third, the behaviors were related to role-play performance and predicted future interpersonal performance. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of this study's granular, behavior-driven perspective.},

  abstract={Background Social skills are important for future physicians and are therefore increasingly considered in selection processes. One economic assessment method from which different social skills can be inferred are Situational Judgment Tests (SJTs) in which applicants are asked to rate behavioral responses in context-relevant situations. However, traditional SJTs have so far failed to distinctively measure specified constructs. To address this shortcoming in the medical admission context, we applied a construct-driven approach of SJT development in which test development was deductively guided by agency and communion as target constructs. Method The final version of the construct-driven SJT includes 15 items per construct with three behavioral responses. Medical school applicants (N = 1527) completed the construct-driven SJT, a traditional SJT, and an aptitude test under high-stakes condition as part of their application. A subsample (N = 575) participated in a subsequent voluntary online study with self-report measures of personality and past behavior. Results The proposed two-factor structure and internal consistency of the construct-driven SJT was confirmed. Communal SJT scores were positively associated with self-reported communal personality and communal behavior, yet effects were smaller than expected. Findings for agentic SJT scores were mixed with positive small associations to self-reported agentic personality scores and agentic behavior but unexpected negative relations to communal self-reported measures. Conclusions Results suggest that construct-driven SJTs might overcome validity limitations of traditional SJTs, although their implementation is challenging. Despite first indicators of validity, future research needs to address practical points of application in high-stakes settings, inclusion of other constructs, and especially prediction of actual behavior before the application of construct-driven SJTs for selection purposes in medical admission can be recommended.},

  abstract={The increase in aggressiveness and disrespect to their peers in physically active teenagers and adolescents has become a major topic in the academic world. Risky behavior in teenagers has been attributed to biological, psychological and social factors. Therefore, it is essential to pay much attention to educational programs that develop a person's physical, emotional, social and cognitive aspects. It has been concluded that positive behavior skills education may be beneficial in personality development. However, there are not many educational programs based on the current theoretical knowledge about the development of positive behavior skills. In addition to this, no educational program, that is based on the positive behavior skills, has been applied in the education of young sportspeople. The aim of our qualitative study was to analyze the theoretical foundations for education of positive behavior skills among young athletes. This qualitative study is based on a directed content analysis strategy. The methods used in the course of this study are analysis of academic literature, synthesis, summarizing, grouping and comparing. It has been highlighted that the construct of positive behavior skills comprises positive personal, positive social and positive emotional skills, that create a multi-layered structural model of positive behavior skills. The types of positive personal, positive social and positive emotional behavior skills are crucial when putting together educational programs for young sportspeople and their well-being. Concluding the results of our theoretical analysis, positive social, positive personal and positive emotional skills should be prioritized in educational programs that develop young athletes' positive behavior skills.},

  abstract={People differ in their social, emotional, and behavioral (SEB) skills: their capacities to maintain social relationships, regulate emotions, and manage goal- and learning-directed behaviors. In five studies using data from seven independent samples (N = 6,309), we address three key questions about the nature, structure, assessment, and outcomes of SEB skills. First, how can SEB skills be defined and distinguished from other kinds of psychological constructs, such as personality traits? We propose that SEB skills represent how someone is capable of thinking, feeling, and behaving when the situation calls for it, whereas traits represent how someone tends to think, feel, and behave averaged across situations. Second, how can specific SEB skills be organized within broader domains? We find that many skill facets can be organized within five major domains representing Social Engagement, Cooperation, Self-Management, Emotional Resilience, and Innovation Skills. Third, how should SEB skills be measured? We develop and validate the Behavioral, Emotional, and Social Skills Inventory (BESSI) to measure individuals' capacity to enact specific behaviors representing 32 skill facets. We then use the BESSI to investigate the nomological network of SEB skills. We show that both skill domains and facets converge in conceptually meaningful ways with socioemotional competencies, character and developmental strengths, and personality traits, and predict consequential outcomes including academic achievement and engagement, occupational interests, social relationships, and well-being. We believe that this work provides the most comprehensive model currently available for conceptualizing SEB skills, as well as the most psychometrically robust tool available for assessing them.},

In particular, personality psychology has a prescribed set of four responsibilities that it implicitly or explicitly tackles as a field: (a) describing what personality is-i.e., what the units of analysis in the field are; (b) documenting how it develops; (c) explaining the processes of personality and why they affect functioning; and (d) providing a framework for understanding individuals and explaining their actions, feelings, and motivations. We review progress made over the last 20 years to address these four agendas and conclude by highlighting future directions and ongoing challenges to the field.},

Data collection on 70 talented adolescent soccer players (ages 15-19 years) from a French-speaking part of Switzerland was based on McAdams' framework. Data were processed to identify main team characteristics and differences between subgroups compared to standard values. Results suggested needs for psychological support in four domains: (a) management of emotional stability to reduce anxiety regarding performance and interactions with coaches; (b) enhancement of involvement in practice, including conscientiousness, quality of practice, and building positive and supportive relationships with coaches; (c) protection against substance abuse and doping; and (d) appropriation of activities that improve performance and increase the likelihood of benefiting from the challenges. The results indicate how these tools can be packaged as a set for overseeing talent development in general. Public Significance Statement This study suggests that regular multilevel assessment of personality factors is a key method that offers useful information to oversee the psychological development of talented soccer players.},

The goal of this paper is to take a step back and to outline several theoretical and methodological considerations when researching employee experiences and behavior in times of crisis more generally. These insights may be useful when developing conceptual models, designing empirical studies, and managing people in the context of future crises. We first review theoretical approaches that could be applied to explain changes in employee experiences and behavior in times of crisis, including stress theories, theories of adjustment to work-related changes, career construction theory, event system theory, transition-adaptation theories, the crisis management and resilience framework, and the social identity model of identity change. Second, we outline methodological considerations and best practices regarding the research design of quantitative empirical studies, sampling, measurement, and analytic strategies. Throughout, we highlight empirical studies on employee experiences and behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic that have adopted these theoretical approaches and methodological best practices. We conclude with several suggestions for future theory development and empirical studies on employee experiences and behavior as well as human resource management in times of crisis.},

  abstract={In recent years, there has been a growing interest in social and emotional skills (SES) both in the scientific literature and in social practice. The paper presents an overview of the ways of understanding what SES are and the catalogs thereof. There are some attempts in the literature to organize these catalogs within the Big Five traits that for a long time was claimed to be the most sound model of basic orthogonal dimensions of personality. However, further research on personality structure revealed that two metatraits can be found above the Big Five traits. These two metatraits form the basis of the Two Factor Model of personality, which was later developed into the Circumplex of Personality Metatraits. It turned out that in certain aspects models based on metatraits have a greater theoretical potential than those based on the Big Five traits. The paper presents a proposal for describing SES from the perspective of the Circumplex of Personality Metatraits rather than the Big Five. In this framework, we distinguish the concept of personality competences that underlie and organize many specific SES and identify the core personality competencies on the basis of the Circumplex of Personality Metatraits model.},

  abstract={Individual extraversion is considered to be one of the most consistent predictors of leadership emergence according to meta-analytic support, but inconsistent empirical results indicate that their relationship may be more nuanced than scholars have concluded. We propose two key reasons for why the extraversion-emergence relationship has yielded inconsistent results. First, we challenge one of the fundamental theoretical assumptions regarding why extraverts emerge as leaders, namely, that extraverts have high levels of communication skill. Drawing on the personality literature, we argue that rather than being inextricably linked to extraversion, communication skill not only plays a separate role but also may determine when extraversion relates to emergence. Second, we test a multilevel model accounting for the team context by proposing in alignment with the social identity model of leadership that a team's overall level of extraversion impacts the team's leadership prototypes and thus the importance of extraversion and communication skill for leadership emergence. We test our hypotheses across two studies in assessment center contexts. We find broad support for our multilevel model and show that extraversion's effects may be much more conditional than previously assumed, whereas communication skill may be a more promising explanatory factor. Thus, we provide a more complete understanding of why and when interpersonal characteristics relate to leadership emergence.},

In particular, we argue that interventions will be most effective when they target the appropriate psychological process given the disposition of the participant and the desired duration of change. Considering these dimensions can help to reveal the differences among common types of behavior-change problems, and it can guide decisions about what kinds of intervention solutions will most effectively solve them. We review key concepts and findings from the personality literature that can help us understand the dynamic nature of dispositions and to identify the psychological processes that best explain both short-term variance in behavior and long-term development of personality. Drawing on this literature, we argue that different types of behavior-change problems require different forms of ``trait regulation,{''} and we offer a series of propositions to be evaluated as potential guides for the design of intervention strategies to address them.},

Despite near-consensus on the importance of SEB skills for success in life, there are numerous frameworks that simultaneously converge and diverge in how they define and measure SEB skills. In this article, we discuss our integrative model encompassing five broad skill domains: Self-Management, Innovation, Social Engagement, Cooperation, and Emotional Resilience Skills (Soto et al., 2021a). Our model defines SEB skills as skills (i.e., what someone is capable of doing) and not traits (i.e., what someone tends to do). Using this definition and model as a foundation, we argue for the importance of investigating SEB skill development during adolescence, a period where SEB skills may be both particularly amenable to change and particularly predictive of life outcomes. In particular, we highlight how SEB skills allow adolescents to take advantage of the new opportunities afforded to them as they make major cognitive and social transitions.},

  abstract={Social skills (e.g., persuading others, showing compassion, staying calm) are of key importance in work and education settings. Accordingly, the goal of many selection processes is to identify candidates who excel in desired skills. For this, high-fidelity simulations such as assessment centers (ACs) are regarded as ideal procedures because they can be used to evoke, observe, and evaluate candidates' actual behavior. However, research has repeatedly shown that observed performance differences in ACs are not sufficiently driven by the specific skill dimensions that are defined for assessment. Building on multiple speed assessments and incorporating insights from behavioral personality science, we offer an alternative approach for the reliable and valid assessment of distinct social skills. We hereby (a) selected skills on the basis of a bottom-up analysis of observable and distinguishable interpersonal behaviors and (b) specifically designed exercises around these skills (i.e., one skill per exercise, multiple exercises per skill). Here, we present the initial results of this newly developed procedure across three samples in a high-stakes selection context (N = 589). Generalizability theory analyses showed that a substantial amount of variance in assessor ratings could be attributed to the selected skills. This underlines the importance of more behaviorally focused selection procedures.},

A heterogeneous group of 324 employees in Sweden provided data on workplace bullying, perceived health-related quality of life, and personality traits, controlling for sex and age. We found that openness (HEXACO model) and Machiavellianism (Dark Triad model) served as moderators. Employees with high values of these traits experienced significantly less affected health-related quality of life when facing workplace bullying. Our results indicate evolutionary origins of the personality traits openness and Machiavellianism. A new finding is that possessing, exhibiting, and maintaining traits reflecting a more creative and competitive interpersonal style increases an employee?s ability to survive aversive environments.},

In an effort to create an integrative framework, this focused review evaluates different approaches of conceptualizing and assessing social-emotional competences. Building on shared conceptions, an integrative taxonomy ``DOMASEC{''} is introduced, specifying core domains and manifestations of social-emotional competences that bridge across frameworks focusing on social and emotional learning, personality traits (such as the Big Five) and self-determination theory. Core domains include intrapersonal, interpersonal and task-oriented competencies, differentiating between affective, cognitive, and behavioral manifestations of competences across these domains. It is argued that the integrative taxonomy facilitates the conceptual specification of key constructs, that it helps to better organize the multitude of terms and definitions used, and to guide the conceptualization and operationalization of social-emotional competences and their various facets.},

Using a combination of classical and S-1 bifactor models, we find that (a) a first-order oblique and bifactor model provide excellent and comparably fitting representation of an EI structure with self-regulatory skills operating independent of general ability, (b) residualized EI abilities uniquely predict criteria over general cognitive ability as referenced by fluid intelligence, and (c) emotion recognition and regulation incrementally predict grade point average (GPA) and affective engagement in opposing directions, after controlling for fluid general ability and the Big Five personality traits. Results are qualified by psychometric analyses suggesting only emotion regulation has enough determinacy and reliable variance beyond a general ability factor to be treated as a manifest score in analyses and interpretation. Findings call for renewed, albeit tempered, research on EI as a multidimensional intelligence and highlight the need for refined assessment of emotional perception, understanding, and management to allow focused analyses of different EI abilities.},

  abstract={Although research suggests that most people want to change their personality traits, previous studies have neither explored whether individuals also desire to change the social, emotional, and behavioral (SEB) skills linked to those traits, nor whether people have different beliefs about the malleability of skills vs. traits. In the present within-person experiment, 264 young adults from the US and Italy rated their desire to change each of the Big Five personality traits and the corresponding domains of SEB skills. They also rated their beliefs about the feasibility, motivation, and impact of making these changes. Results showed that participants reported similar or higher scores for skills, compared to traits, across all measured outcomes. Specifically, scores for social engagement and self-management skills were consistently higher than those for extraversion and conscientiousness. These findings indicate that people believe it to be more desirable-and more feasible-to change some SEB skills than the corresponding personality traits.},

  abstract={This study examined adolescents' social-emotional skills profiles before the educational transition to upper secondary education. Further, the study examined differences in gender; socioeconomic status (SES); and perceived social relationships, educational aspirations, and school anxiety across the profiles. The study used OECD data collected from 2452 adolescents aged 15 from 53 schools in Helsinki. Using latent profile analysis, five social-emotional skills profiles were identified: average (54\%), average-high (23\%), empathic-stressed (10\%), low-empathic-tolerant (10\%), and high (3\%). Further analyses revealed that adolescents with high social and emotional skills generally reported higher educational aspirations, lower school anxiety, and perceived their relationships at school more positively. However, adolescents with empathic-stressed profile reported similarly high educational aspirations and high school anxiety. Girls were more likely to belong to the empathic-stressed and low-empathic-tolerant profiles, and adolescents with lower SES to low-empathic-tolerant or average profiles. The findings may inform more targeted strength-based school practices.},

  abstract={Drawing on the nationally representative Longitudinal Study of Young People in England (LSYPE; n = 15,770), this study assesses the role of academic agency (an aspect of self-directed engagement with learning and education) in enabling socioeconomically disadvantaged youth to complete secondary education. Academic agency is operationalised as a multi-dimensional construct, comprising education expectations, academic self-concept, and school engagement. The findings suggest that academic agency can act as an independent resource, over and above family socioeconomic status (indicated by parental education and social class). There was also evidence of resource substitution, i.e., academic agency reduces the risk of low educational attainment for those with few family socioeconomic resources. Moreover, there is evidence of `ethnic capital' as ethnic minority youth with high academic expectations were more likely to achieve key educational milestones. The results are discussed regarding interlinked inequalities of sex, minority status, and family socioeconomic status.},

  abstract={Growing up is rarely easy, yet adolescents and young adults today are reporting distress at rates never seen before. We propose this trend can be traced to societal forces that accelerate and suppress development, resulting in developmental anxiety (i.e., worry about meeting adult milestones on time, if ever). Drawing on foundational theories from developmental and family sciences, we introduce hurries and waits as umbrella terms for these simultaneous and contradictory forces and explain how developmental anxiety may arise from the tension they place on young people. We next identify strengths that both young people and their families can use to navigate hurry-wait tension, and close with an agenda for future research. This updated, systems-based lens on the transition to adulthood prepares the field to help young people achieve the fulfilling adult life that previous generations looked forward to with greater promise.},

  abstract={Background Rapid urbanization is underway in China. However, the impact of urbanization on frailty remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the relationship between urbanization and frailty among middle-aged and older adults. Methods We analyzed nationally representative data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) spanning 2011 to 2018. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 10,758 non-frail individuals at baseline were analyzed. The exposure of interest was the comprehensive urbanization level. Urbanization level (0.072-0.689) was assessed using the entropy method. Frailty was assessed using the frailty index (FI), which ranges from 0 to 100. Frailty was defined as FI >= 25, and the urbanization-frailty association was assessed using - the restricted cubic spline (RCS) expressions and Cox proportional hazards models. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression were employed to evaluate major factors associated with frailty. Results The results revealed a U-shaped nonlinear association between urbanization level and frailty incidence, with a turning point at 0.3 (P-nonlinear < 0.001). In the Cox model, for urbanization scores below 0.3, each ten-percentile increase was associated with an HR of 0.871 (95\% CI 0.843-0.900, P < 0.05). Conversely, scores at or above 0.3 had an HR of 1.178 (95\% CI 1.053-1.319, P < 0.05) per ten-percentile increase. In the subgroup analysis of participants with urbanization scores below 0.3, there was a significant interaction between current work status and subgroups with dyslipidemia. LASSO regression showed that, for urbanization scores < 0.3, total retail sales (coefficient = - 0.129) and per capita income (coefficient = - 0.071) were most protective against frailty. For scores >= 0.3, key urbanization factors associated with increased frailty risk included the number of college students per 10,000 people (coefficient = 0.080) and the proportion of built-up land in the urban area (coefficient = 0.060). Conclusions Urbanization level had U-shaped association with frailty incidence. Factors such as total retail sales of consumer goods per capita, per capita disposable income of urban residents, and the number of college students per 10,000 people may be key in formulating a strategy for frailty prevention.},

  abstract={Maintaining a positive mindset is important for leadership effectiveness and may even be more important in times of a crisis because such a mindset contributes to organizational survival and resilience. In this study, we examined whether leaders' positive mindset helped to mitigate the harmful effects of the COVID-19 crisis on organizations and if so, how. To address this issue, we conducted an empirical study through LinkedIn with 165 participants working in various organizations in Canada. The results show that leaders' positive mindset positively impacts leaders' innovative behavior. However, leaders' innovative behavior did not attenuate the negative effects of the COVID-19 crisis on organizations, except when we introduce the use of information and communication technology (ICT) and the provision of psychological support to employees as moderators. The implications of these findings for both theory and practice, as well as some future research directions are discussed.},

  language={English},
  abstract={Evidence across the social sciences suggests the importance of social, emotional, and behavioral (SEB) skills for a wide variety of youth outcomes. However, most of this work is cross-sectional. We know little about how patterns of change in adolescents' SEB skills may be related to commensurate patterns of change in important outcomes across an academic year. Drawing from a sample of American secondary school students (N = 942), this longitudinal study employs latent change score models to fill that gap. We report four key findings. We find that (1) a short version of the Behavioral, Emotional, and Social Skills Inventory (BESSI) is psychometrically suitable for longitudinal analyses. We further find that (2) SEB skills are highly stable, on average, but also (3) characterized by significant between-person variation in change. Centrally, we find that (4) positive changes in SEB skills are related to changes in academic engagement, friendship quality, anxiety, depression, life satisfaction, as well as other measures of social and emotional competencies. Taken together, the results suggest that SEB skills are malleable, but future work is needed to identify patterns of change and develop and test targeted interventions.},

  author={De Fruyt, Filip and Scheirlinckx, Joyce},
  language={English},
  abstract={Purpose This review paper addresses three major challenges hindering progress in the field of social-emotional learning in education.Design/Approach/Methods We first discuss how social-emotional skills could be conceptualized, contrasting identity versus self-efficacy approaches. Second, we argue to develop more objective assessments of social-emotional skills and their development, as a supplement of currently and frequently used self- and informant descriptions relying on Likert-based scales. Third and finally, we discuss recurrent issues that are raised when debating the implementation of social-emotional skill learning in the classroom.Findings The review suggests that, at this point in time, both self-efficacy and identity conceptualizations of social-emotional skills are valuable approaches. Future research will need to explore which conceptualization for which skills demonstrates the best predictive validity, taking into account the nature of outcomes and contexts. The desired characteristics of more objective social-emotional skill measures are defined, and we encourage to examine how these overlap with self-reports using construct maps. Finally, we underscore the importance of having a comprehensive and evidence-informed taxonomy of social-emotional skills to guide the debate on the inclusion of social-emotional skill learning in curricula and its implementation in the classroom.Originality/Value This short review is primarily written for practitioners and policymakers to give a quick and accessible update on the key challenges in social-emotional learning today. The review should trigger more in-depth reading on the topic, but also support readers to understand current problems and help them dealing with questions and potential objections that might be raised by different stakeholders.},

Students with MD (n = 35), RD (n = 27), MDRD (n = 43), and typically-developing peers (TD, n = 167) completed the Children's Depression Inventory, the Children's Loneliness Questionnaire, the Social Anxiety Questionnaire, and the Survey on Social Emotional Skills (SSES). In regard to mental health, results showed that MDRD experienced significantly higher levels of loneliness compared to TD, while MD had significantly higher levels of depression than TD. No significant differences were found in mental health outcomes between the MD, RD, and MDRD groups. In regard to social-emotional skills, the results showed that MD had significantly lower levels of persistence, responsibility, self-control, emotional control, curiosity, and energy compared to TD. MDRD also showed significantly lower curiosity compared to TD. There were no significant differences in task performance, emotional regulation, collaboration, and open-mindedness among the MD, RD, and MDRD groups. These findings suggest that different learning difficulties are associated with distinct profiles of mental health and social-emotional skills.},

  language={English},
  abstract={Introduction: Transitioning from school to higher education or work is a pivotal moment in a student's life, requiring life-changing decisions. During this period, students who have acquired a wide range of Social, Emotional, and Behavioral (SEB) skills may feel more confident regarding their capacity to adapt positively to future challenges and difficulties. Our study aimed to test whether five SEB skills domains (self-management, innovation, social engagement, cooperation, and emotional resilience skills) were associated with four career adaptability resources (i.e., concern, control, curiosity, and confidence). Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 350 Italian students (143 boys; Mage = 16.65) at the end of their last or penultimate year of high school (May-June 2024). We ran a multivariate regression analysis to examine specific associations between SEB skills domains and career adaptability resources. Furthermore, we tested a structural equation model including a latent factor of career-adaptability as the dependent variable, and SEB skills domains as predictors. Results: Our results showed that students who described themselves as more competent in self-management, innovation, and social engagement skills reported higher levels of career adaptability (considering both the latent factor and the specific resources). Conclusions: Our findings highlight the importance of feeling competent in different domains, not just academics, as the perception of having tools and skills could make students more confident in their ability to face future challenges and adapt to their future careers.},

  abstract={Emotion, a fundamental mapping of human responses to external stimuli, has been extensively studied in human-computer interaction, particularly in areas such as intelligent cockpits and systems. However, accurately recognizing emotions from facial expressions remains a significant challenge due to lighting conditions, posture, and micro-expressions. Emotion recognition using global or local facial features is a key research direction. However, relying solely on global or local features often results in models that exhibit uneven attention across facial features, neglecting key variations critical for detecting emotional changes. This paper proposes a method for modeling and extracting key facial features by integrating global and local facial data. First, we construct a comprehensive image preprocessing model that includes super-resolution processing, lighting and shading processing, and texture enhancement. This preprocessing step significantly enriches the expression of image features. Second, A global facial feature recognition model is developed using an encoder-decoder architecture, which effectively eliminates environmental noise and generates a comprehensive global feature dataset for facial analysis. Simultaneously, the Haar cascade classifier is employed to extract refined features from key facial regions, including the eyes, mouth, and overall face, resulting in a corresponding local feature dataset. Finally, a two-branch convolutional neural network is designed to integrate both global and local facial feature datasets, enhancing the model's ability to recognize facial characteristics accurately. The global feature branch fully characterizes the global features of the face, while the local feature branch focuses on the local features. An adaptive fusion module integrates the global and local features, enhancing the model's ability to differentiate subtle emotional changes. To evaluate the accuracy and robustness of the model, we train and test it on the FER-2013 and JAFFE emotion datasets, achieving average accuracies of 80.59\% and 97.61\%, respectively. Compared to existing state-of-the-art models, our refined face feature extraction and fusion model demonstrates superior performance in emotion recognition. Additionally, the comparative analysis shows that emotional features across different faces show similarities. Building on psychological research, we categorize the dataset into three emotion classes: positive, neutral, and negative. The accuracy of emotion recognition is significantly improved under the new classification criteria. Additionally, the self-built dataset is used to validate further that this classification approach has important implications for practical applications.},

  abstract={Introduction Social-emotional skills are essential in everyday interaction and develop in early and middle childhood. However, there is no German instrument to help primary school students identify their strengths and weaknesses in different social-emotional skills that does not rely on written language. This paper introduces a new digital instrument, the GraSEF: Grazer Screening to assess Social-Emotional Skills, which was developed to measure (1) Behavior in Social Situations, (2) Prosocial Behavior, (3) Emotion Regulation Strategies, (4) Emotion Recognition and (5) Self-Perception of Emotions using different test formats (e.g., situational judgement test, self-assessment, performance tests). In the GraSEF, students work through an online survey tool, using audio instructions to guide them through the test.Methods The present study analyses the responses of second graders (Mage = 8.23 years, SDage = 0.48, 48\% female). The intention was to gain initial insight into the instrument's psychometric quality and user-friendliness.Results In general, the instrument was found to have acceptable to good internal consistency, sufficient discriminatory power and item difficulty. However, one subtest (5: Self-Perception of Emotions), as well as three situations of the situational judgment test (1: Behavior in Social Situations), were excluded due to unsatisfactory fit and distribution. The validity check revealed low to moderate correlations between teacher rating and student scores. On average, students completed the screening in about 30 min and provided positive feedback regarding usability.Discussion While the small sample size only provides preliminary insight into the instrument's psychometric quality, the results suggest that the GraSEF can reliably measure various dimensions of social-emotional skills in second graders, even among those with low reading skills.},
