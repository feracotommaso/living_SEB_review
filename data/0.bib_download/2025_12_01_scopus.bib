	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic had a profound impact on education globally, from primary to tertiary levels. Many studies have been conducted to better understand the cognitive and psychological effects of this pandemic, including research on a variety of topics (e.g., school closures, online teaching and learning, mental and physical health), populations (e.g., students and instructors), and educational levels (e.g., school, higher education). Numerous systematic reviews and meta-analyses provide both qualitative and quantitative summaries of the literature on specific effects of the pandemic on education. In this chapter, we present a systematic meta-review of these reports to synthesize and combine this existing database and derive broader and more comprehensive insights that can aid educational stakeholders moving forward. We identified 5806 records, and after screening abstracts and full-texts, a total of 55 reports were included in our review: 43 systematic reviews, 4 meta-anal-yses, and 8 combined systematic reviews and meta-analyses published until November 2022. Through thematic synthesis, we identified six groups of psychological and cognitive variables: mental health, emotional experiences, attitudes and worries, social relationships, achievement-related variables, and meaning. For each of these groups, we discuss key findings to provide a detailed narrative of psychological and cognitive implications of COVID-19 that can inform future educational practices and policies. © 2025 Information Age Publishing Inc.},

	abstract = {A growing body of evidence has found that social and emotional (SE) skills are positively associated with many school-related outcomes. In recent years, the Big Five personality framework has gained support as an organizing framework for various SE skills. While many prominent taxonomies of SE skills map to the Big Five, several additional models include skills related to motivation and growth mindset that do not align with the Big Five. We examined the extent to which these constructs overlapped with SE skills organized by the Big Five framework and whether they provided incremental validity in predicting school-related outcomes. ACT test takers (N = 1755) from across the United States, mostly from high-income families and predominantly in 11th or 12th grade, completed several measures. These included a measure of SE skills as organized by the Big Five (i.e., BFI-2-S), items on school-related outcomes, measures of motivation (i.e., MSLQ, Expectancy-Value-Cost Scale, Self-Determination Scale), and a measure of growth mindset (i.e., the Growth Mindset Scale). We found that growth mindset and motivation correlated with SE skills as organized by the Big Five. These constructs also helped predict additional variance in school-related outcomes, such as GPA and ACT scores. Given the independent contributions of growth mindset and motivation, incorporating these constructs into school-based assessments, alongside SE skills, could be beneficial in supporting students. Impact Statement: The results from this study suggest that measuring growth mindset and motivation along with social and emotional skills could help to better predict which students are likely to be successful academically. From a theoretical standpoint, the current study suggests the Big Five alone may not fully capture all factors relevant for student success. © 2025},

	abstract = {LLMs exhibit promising Social Intelligence (SI) in modeling human behavior, raising the need to evaluate LLMs' SI and their discrepancy with humans. SI equips humans with interpersonal abilities to behave wisely in navigating social interactions to achieve social goals. This presents an operational evaluation paradigm: outcome-oriented goal achievement evaluation and process-oriented interpersonal ability evaluation, which existing work fails to address. To this end, we propose SOCIALEVAL, a script-based bilingual SI benchmark, integrating outcome- and process-oriented evaluation by manually crafting narrative scripts. Each script is structured as a world tree that contains plot lines driven by interpersonal ability, providing a comprehensive view of how LLMs navigate social interactions. Experiments show that LLMs fall behind humans on both SI evaluations, exhibit prosociality, and prefer more positive social behaviors, even if they lead to goal failure. Analysis of LLMs' formed representation space and neuronal activations reveals that LLMs have developed ability-specific functional partitions akin to the human brain. © 2025 Association for Computational Linguistics.},
