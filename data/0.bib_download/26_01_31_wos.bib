Abstract = {Finding a job that fits is widely recognized as important for personal
   fulfillment and professional success. Despite the long history of
   person-environment fit research, surprisingly little is known about
   person-job fit in terms of basic personality traits. This study examined
   three basic tenets of fit theory regarding personality-job fit: Fit (1)
   is pleasurable, (2) regulated by individuals, and (3) changes over time.
   We hypothesized that personality-job fit would be associated with higher
   subjective well-being (RQ1), predict less occupational change (RQ2), and
   vary across the professional lifespan (RQ3). Fit was conceptualized as
   ``broad congruence{''} between individuals' Big Five trait levels and
   expert-rated trait demands of their occupations. We used nationally
   representative data from German jobholders (N = 18,712-30,883).
   Multilevel polynomial regression and response surface analysis showed no
   significant congruence effects but some interactions: More extraverted
   and open individuals felt better and were less likely to leave their
   jobs when these traits were strongly demanded by their work, though
   these outcomes were not optimized at exact personality-job fit.
   Additionally, personality-job fit improved over time, showing a linear
   increase across the lifespan. These findings emphasize studying fit
   theories in detail and considering individuals' personalities, such as
   being communicative or original, in career choice.},

Title = {Agreeableness of Adolescents during and after the COVID-19 Pandemic
   (2021-2024): Influence of Gender and Education Level},
Journal = {CHILD INDICATORS RESEARCH},
Year = {2026},
Month = {2026 JAN 6},
Abstract = {The research aims to analyze changes in agreeableness and its
   subcomponents: empathy, respect, and trust during and after the COVID-19
   pandemic (2021-2024), while evaluating demographic influences of
   education level and gender. This trend study used independent samples of
   adolescents, collected annually from 2021 to 2024. The data collection
   instrument was the Agreeableness Scale from the Semente Panel of
   Socioemotional Skills. We conducted comparative analyses to identify
   significant differences in the scores of overall agreeableness and its
   subcomponents, based on the year of data collection, educational level
   (upper elementary school vs. high school), and gender. We observed a
   significant drop in agreeableness scores in 2022 and 2023, a period
   marked by the prolonged impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2024, we
   identified a recovery in the levels of this skill. Students in upper
   elementary school had higher agreeableness scores compared to those in
   high school. Regarding gender, female high school students showed higher
   levels of empathy and respect, while upper elementary school students
   showed greater trust.The socioemotional skills analyzed were affected by
   the COVID-19 pandemic and showed changes over time, according to the
   education level and gender. The results support the importance of
   promoting educational interventions aimed at strengthening
   socioemotional development, especially in times of crisis, to foster
   students' social adaptation.},

Abstract = {LLMs exhibit promising Social Intelligence (SI) in modeling human
   behavior, raising the need to evaluate LLMs' SI and their discrepancy
   with humans. SI equips humans with interpersonal abilities to behave
   wisely in navigating social interactions to achieve social goals. This
   presents an operational evaluation paradigm: outcome-oriented goal
   achievement evaluation and process-oriented interpersonal ability
   evaluation, which existing work fails to address. To this end, we
   propose SOCIALEVAL, a script-based bilingual SI benchmark, integrating
   outcome- and process-oriented evaluation by manually crafting narrative
   scripts. Each script is structured as a world tree that contains plot
   lines driven by interpersonal ability, providing a comprehensive view of
   how LLMs navigate social interactions. Experiments show that LLMs fall
   behind humans on both SI evaluations, exhibit prosociality, and prefer
   more positive social behaviors, even if they lead to goal failure.
   Analysis of LLMs' formed representation space and neuronal activations
   reveals that LLMs have developed ability-specific functional partitions
   akin to the human brain.1},
