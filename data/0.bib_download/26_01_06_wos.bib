Abstract = {This longitudinal study examined the association between teachers'
   Social, Emotional, and Moral Competencies (SEMC) and their teaching of
   SEMC, considering the mediating effect of perception of the importance
   of promoting SEMC and planning of the teaching of SEMC. The sample
   included 731 teachers at Wave 1 and 1131 teachers at Wave 2, with 370
   teachers participating in both waves. Results showed that teachers' SEMC
   positively predicted their teaching of SEMC, mediated by perception of
   the importance of promoting SEMC and planning of the teaching of SEMC.
   Findings suggest the need to develop specific teacher training to
   promote these competencies among students.},

Title = {Examining the effect of STEAM Maker Instruction (SMI) on socioemotional

Abstract = {This study examined the impact of STEAM Maker Instruction (SMI) on the
   acquisition of a third language, and the development of socioemotional
   skills among multi-ethnic undergraduates (n = 265). By integrating the
   5E instructional model with 36 real-world business projects, this study
   aimed to bridge the gap between traditional multiethnic classrooms and
   societal expectations. Analysis of the data indicated that
   socioemotional skills are essential in managing students' anxiety and
   aspirations, which in turn fosters their creativity and academic
   performance in English for Specific Purposes (ESP). The 5E model
   significantly improved students' business knowledge, learning skills,
   and attitudes, including learning capacity, social interaction,
   self-regulation, open innovation, team collaboration, and creativity.
   Social interactions, which rely on self-regulation, self-management, and
   resilience, were found to be essential for fostering creativity. This
   study demonstrated that SMI can develop socioemotional skills through
   engagement with real-world business projects. It offers a pathway for
   multicultural classroom teaching by incorporating SMI into undergraduate
   curricula. Nonetheless, this study acknowledges certain limitations,
   such as the limited sample size and concentration in a specific academic
   field. Future research should explore the long-term effects of
   socio-emotional skills and academic outcomes beyond the classroom. This
   includes examining the relationships among emotional engagement,
   behavioral engagement, and self-efficacy in the context of career
   decision-making strategies.},

Title = {``Freely explore this environment{''}: individual differences in
   exploration behavior and survey knowledge},
Journal = {COGNITIVE RESEARCH-PRINCIPLES AND IMPLICATIONS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 19},
Abstract = {When navigating individuals form mental representations of their
   environment. Significant individual differences exist, particularly in
   the ability to develop survey knowledge-a map-like understanding of
   spatial relationships. While many studies have focused on navigation via
   predetermined routes, less is known about individual differences in
   learning environments from free exploration. This study investigated
   whether exploration behaviors, such as the tendency to revisit places or
   diffuse in the environment, are linked to mental representations and
   whether visuospatial factors, like visuospatial working memory and
   self-reported wayfinding inclinations (e.g., self-efficacy and pleasure
   in exploring, and spatial anxiety), contribute to these relationships. A
   sample of 234 participants (147 womencompleted a visuospatial working
   memory task and wayfinding questionnaires, then freely explored a
   virtual city in a CAVE environment. Revisiting (tendency to re-explore
   visited areas) and diffusion (extent of environmental coverage) were
   calculated. Their survey knowledge was assessed using a map drawing
   task. The results showed that exploration behaviors were related to
   individual differences: women exhibited less revisiting and diffusion
   than men; higher self-efficacy and pleasure in exploring were associated
   with reduced revisiting; and joystick familiarity favoured diffusion.
   Furthermore, exploration behaviors mediated the relationship between
   gender and self-efficacy and pleasure in exploring with map accuracy.
   Map drawing was also directly predicted by visuospatial working memory
   ability. These findings offer insights into the role of individual
   differences in exploration behaviors and their relationship to survey
   knowledge gained from free exploration, highlighting the importance of
   individual factors in how environments are experienced and
   processed.Significance statementSome people are better at understanding
   where landmarks are in a place and how they are connected, while others
   find it more difficult. This paper investigates whether the way we move
   through an environment (how we explore) relates to this ability, along
   with other personal factors. When exploring a city, some people move
   around a lot, while others stay closer to familiar areas. We found that
   this is related to how well people understand the layout of the place.
   Importantly, we also found that personal attitudes toward orientation
   matter: people who feel more confident and enjoy exploring tend to
   revisit places less. On the other hand, the ability to mentally handle
   visual and spatial information (visuospatial working memory) doesn't
   change how we explore, but it does help us build a better understanding
   of the environment. Gender and familiarity with using a joystick also
   related to how people explored and what they learned. By studying how
   people move and how this relates to their individual characteristics, we
   can better understand how we learn about the environments.},

Year = {2025},

Abstract = {Despite the proliferation of artificially intelligent systems capable of
   social interaction, how and why social interaction influences users over
   time remains poorly understood. We draw on theories of technology
   adoption and research in affective computing, social psychology, and
   management to introduce the concept of human-AI relationships involving
   interdependence, temporality, and intensity. We develop the Relational
   Tradeoff Model, extending current theorizing on technology adoption by
   accounting for a critical third factor in addition to cognitive
   acceptance and behavioral use: human subjective well-being. The model
   reveals an important unexplored tradeoff in relationships with socially
   interactive AI: short-term acceptance and use gains but long-term
   subjective well-being costs for trust, psychological safety, and
   emotional labor, depending on AI social function and exacerbating and
   mitigating individual and relational factors. We discuss implications
   and suggestions for future exploration, including intrapersonal,
   interpersonal, and team relational dynamics and evolving expectations of
   AI in organizations.},

Journal = {SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {28},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In this study, we investigated perceived social-emotional competence
   (PSEC) among 373 Australian secondary school students in relation to
   parent ratings of social-emotional skills, and perceived teacher and
   parental autonomy support. Using bifactor exploratory structural
   equation modelling, we examined five dimensions of PSEC (perceived
   competence for assertiveness, tolerance, social regulation, emotion
   regulation, and emotional awareness), identifying a global factor and
   five specific factors. Following that, we employed structural equation
   modelling to investigate links between these global and specific factors
   and five parent-reported social-emotional skills: leadership, cultural
   competence, teamwork, cognitive reappraisal, and capacity for emotional
   reflection. Global PSEC was associated positively with all skills,
   whereas the specific factors were, with one exception, each associated
   with greater parent-rated skill in a corresponding area (e.g.,
   assertiveness with greater leadership skill; emotion awareness with
   reflective skills). Addressing a second aim of the research, we tested
   the extent to which students' perceptions of autonomy support from
   teachers and parents assessed near the start of a school term were
   associated with both students' PSEC and parent-rated skills assessed at
   the end of the term. Autonomy-supportive parenting was positively
   associated with global PSEC. Autonomy-supportive teaching was associated
   with greater levels of two specific factors: perceived competence for
   assertiveness and social regulation. Together, findings hold relevance
   to knowledge and efforts aimed at enhancing social-emotional skills
   among students.},

Journal = {SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {28},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Social, emotional, and behavioral (SEB) skills- also known under labels
   like soft skills, 21st century skills, or social-emotional skills- are
   considered key factors for students' success, well-being, and social
   relationships, among others. However, literature on the topic relied on
   different frameworks and questionable measurement methods. Additionally,
   they usually did not integrate skills into classical self-regulated
   learning (SRL) frameworks. To overcome these limitations, we adopted the
   new integrative SEB framework and measured SEB skills, along with five
   SRL factors (academic self-efficacy, SRL strategies, mastery learning
   goals, growth mindset, and achievement emotions) and three outcomes
   (i.e., self-reported academic achievement, peer acceptance, and life
   satisfaction). Participants were 5,075 Italian high school students (M =
   18.23 years old; SD = 0.95). Our results show that SEB skills are
   associated with almost all SRL factors and outcomes, but when
   considering their specific role (net of other skills and SRL factors),
   no direct associations with self-reported academic achievement emerge,
   supporting the hypothesis that SEB skills' effects on academic outcomes
   might be mainly explained by SRL factors, while specific skills (i.e.,
   social engagement, collaboration, and emotional resilience skills)
   directly influence non-scholastic outcomes. Our results support the
   importance of adopting integrative skills frameworks along with SRL
   frameworks to deeply understand the processes linking skills to outcomes
   in the student population.},
