	abstract = {Evidence across the social sciences suggests the importance of social, emotional, and behavioral (SEB) skills for a wide variety of youth outcomes. However, most of this work is cross-sectional. We know little about how patterns of change in adolescents’ SEB skills may be related to commensurate patterns of change in important outcomes across an academic year. Drawing from a sample of American secondary school students (N = 942), this longitudinal study employs latent change score models to fill that gap. We report four key findings. We find that (1) a short version of the Behavioral, Emotional, and Social Skills Inventory (BESSI) is psychometrically suitable for longitudinal analyses. We further find that (2) SEB skills are highly stable, on average, but also (3) characterized by significant between-person variation in change. Centrally, we find that (4) positive changes in SEB skills are related to changes in academic engagement, friendship quality, anxiety, depression, life satisfaction, as well as other measures of social and emotional competencies. Taken together, the results suggest that SEB skills are malleable, but future work is needed to identify patterns of change and develop and test targeted interventions. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The present study tested a comprehensive model in which five social, emotional, and behavioral (SEB) skill domains (self-management, social engagement, cooperation, emotional resilience, and innovation; also known as “soft skills”) were associated with academic achievement and satisfaction directly and through the mediation of academic self-efficacy and self-regulated learning (SRL) strategies. The participants were 319 undergraduate students (mean age = 22.74, SD = 4.68; 255 females) from Spain, Italy, and Israel. Self-report questionnaires were administered for this study. Our results showed that academic self-efficacy and SRL significantly mediated the relationships between self-management and social engagement skills with academic achievement, after controlling for sex, age, year of study, and nationality. Academic self-efficacy uniquely mediated the relationship between SEB skills and academic achievement and satisfaction. Fostering socio-emotional skills can benefit students during higher education and lead to positive perceptions of themselves as competent and self-regulated learners, which can lead to greater academic satisfaction and achievement. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Children's perceived parental educational aspirations play an important role in their development. However, few studies have examined the relationships between children's perceived parental educational aspirations and their own educational aspirations, mathematics achievement, and social-emotional competence (SEC), as well as the mediating role of mathematics self-beliefs in these relationships. This study investigated that how children's perceived parental educational aspirations were transmitted into their subsequent educational aspirations, mathematics achievement, and SEC through mathematics self-beliefs. Method: Participants were 3,995 fourth-grade students in China (47.06% girls; M age = 10.76 years, SD = 0.90) selected through cluster random sampling method. Of these, 2,789 were followed up two years later. Students completed a questionnaire that included background information and scales measuring mathematics self-beliefs and SEC, as well as a mathematics achievement test. Structural equation modeling was conducted to examine the predictive effects of children's perceived parental educational aspirations on their educational aspirations, mathematics achievement, and SEC, and the mediating role of mathematics self-beliefs. Results: Results indicated that perceived parental educational aspirations positively predicted mathematics self-beliefs (β = 0.13, p < 0.001), educational aspirations (β = 0.25, p < 0.001), mathematics achievement (β = 0.26, p < 0.001), and SEC (β = 0.14, p < 0.001). Mathematics self-beliefs also positively predicted educational aspirations (β = 0.29, p < 0.001), mathematics achievement (β = 0.45, p < 0.001), and SEC (β = 0.45, p < 0.001). Discussion: These findings highlight the benefits of children's perceived parental educational aspirations for their development and the central role of mathematics self-beliefs. They suggest that when parents demonstrate positive educational expectations, children are more likely to develop positive self-beliefs, which in turn foster higher aspirations, stronger academic performance, and enhanced SEC. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: Growth mindsets refer to the belief that personal attributes can be developed and improved through learning and effort. Much of the prior work on mindsets has focused on mindsets of intelligence, with little attention devoted to whether and how growth mindsets might also be relevant to the domain of social–emotional skills. Aims: To address this gap, this study aimed to extend research on growth mindsets to the domain of social–emotional skills and examine the associations between growth mindsets and various types of social–emotional skills. We explored five broad social–emotional skills and 15 specific facet-level skills, including task performance (self-control, responsibility, persistence), emotional regulation (stress resistance, emotional control, optimism), engaging with others (energy, assertiveness, sociability), collaboration (empathy, cooperation, trust) and open mindedness (curiosity, creativity, tolerance). Sample: We drew on data from 29,798 fifteen-year-old students from 10 cities across nine countries. Methods: Hierarchical linear modelling was employed to investigate the association between growth mindsets and various types of social–emotional skills. Results: Results indicated that a growth mindset of social–emotional skills was positively associated with five broad social–emotional skills: task performance, emotional regulation, engaging with others, collaboration, and open-mindedness. These results also applied to the 15 specific facet-level skills. Interestingly, we also found that mindsets of social–emotional skills were most strongly associated with emotional regulation. Conclusion: This study extended the growth mindset literature by applying it to the domain of social–emotional skills. Our findings may have promising implications for future interventions aimed at improving students' social–emotional skills. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Schools are a critical vehicle for promoting child well-being. Through their climate, organization, policies, and practices, school structures promote or inhibit the developmental trajectories of their students. Schools are increasingly seeing a need for students to develop social emotional skills, particularly in the domain of emotion regulation (ER). This study investigates the influence of school climate, school contexts, and individual demographic factors on the development of ER skills among youth in nine countries. Utilizing data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s Survey on Social and Emotional Skills, this study examines how school contexts (e.g., school climate and school demographics) and individual factors (e.g., sex, SES, and immigrant background) impact students’ abilities to regulate their emotions. The results from hierarchical linear models revealed that students’ perceptions of their school’s climate (belonging, relationships with teachers, and school anxiety) significantly enhance their ER skills, while students’ perceptions of negative school climates were associated with worse ER outcomes. School-level demographics (proportion of minoritized students) predicted ER skills in individual students while individual demographic factors did not have an association with ER skills, with the exception of age. This study underscores the importance of equitable, supportive school environments in fostering youth ER. Policies that reduce inequities, particularly in schools serving minoritized students, are critical for enhancing the emotional and behavioral competencies essential for long-term success and well-being. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},
