	abstract = {Using an exploratory quasi-experimental design, the present research investigated SEB skills as an antecedent and consequence of volunteering in a sample of college students who were either actively volunteering (N = 169) or not (N = 286). Results indicated that more skilled students participated in volunteering, but volunteering, in general, did not predict positive SEB skill change. However, participants who reported interacting with others while volunteering experienced growth in socially relevant skills. Participants who reported positive subjective evaluations of volunteering also experienced growth in several SEB skills. These findings suggest that domain relevant actions, as well as subjective experiences of engaging in those actions, may be critical for positive SEB skill development. © 2026 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {The research aims to analyze changes in agreeableness and its subcomponents: empathy, respect, and trust during and after the COVID-19 pandemic (2021–2024), while evaluating demographic influences of education level and gender. This trend study used independent samples of adolescents, collected annually from 2021 to 2024. The data collection instrument was the Agreeableness Scale from the Semente Panel of Socioemotional Skills. We conducted comparative analyses to identify significant differences in the scores of overall agreeableness and its subcomponents, based on the year of data collection, educational level (upper elementary school vs. high school), and gender. We observed a significant drop in agreeableness scores in 2022 and 2023, a period marked by the prolonged impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2024, we identified a recovery in the levels of this skill. Students in upper elementary school had higher agreeableness scores compared to those in high school. Regarding gender, female high school students showed higher levels of empathy and respect, while upper elementary school students showed greater trust.The socioemotional skills analyzed were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and showed changes over time, according to the education level and gender. The results support the importance of promoting educational interventions aimed at strengthening socioemotional development, especially in times of crisis, to foster students’ social adaptation. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2026.},

	abstract = {This article introduces the dimension of spatial skills—being able to visualize and rotate images and figures in one’s mind’s eye—as a missing aspect and third-dimension in test-based educational accountability, even though it is a well-established cognitive construct (which many scholars consider malleable) in addition to math and verbal achievement that has been linked to long-term outcomes in engineering, robotics, and other areas. In numerous K-12 and higher education standardized tests, in addition to international comparison tests, spatial skills are simply missing. Introducing this dimension would help attention be directed to students with spatial rather than verbal and mathematical reasoning strengths, and may even help expand dimensions of schooling that might be relevant to this current period of digital transformation in the era of data science, AI, and robotics. © The Author(s) 2025.},

	abstract = {When navigating individuals form mental representations of their environment. Significant individual differences exist, particularly in the ability to develop survey knowledge—a map-like understanding of spatial relationships. While many studies have focused on navigation via predetermined routes, less is known about individual differences in learning environments from free exploration. This study investigated whether exploration behaviors, such as the tendency to revisit places or diffuse in the environment, are linked to mental representations and whether visuospatial factors, like visuospatial working memory and self-reported wayfinding inclinations (e.g., self-efficacy and pleasure in exploring, and spatial anxiety), contribute to these relationships. A sample of 234 participants (147 womencompleted a visuospatial working memory task and wayfinding questionnaires, then freely explored a virtual city in a CAVE environment. Revisiting (tendency to re-explore visited areas) and diffusion (extent of environmental coverage) were calculated. Their survey knowledge was assessed using a map drawing task. The results showed that exploration behaviors were related to individual differences: women exhibited less revisiting and diffusion than men; higher self-efficacy and pleasure in exploring were associated with reduced revisiting; and joystick familiarity favoured diffusion. Furthermore, exploration behaviors mediated the relationship between gender and self-efficacy and pleasure in exploring with map accuracy. Map drawing was also directly predicted by visuospatial working memory ability. These findings offer insights into the role of individual differences in exploration behaviors and their relationship to survey knowledge gained from free exploration, highlighting the importance of individual factors in how environments are experienced and processed. Significance statement Some people are better at understanding where landmarks are in a place and how they are connected, while others find it more difficult. This paper investigates whether the way we move through an environment (how we explore) relates to this ability, along with other personal factors. When exploring a city, some people move around a lot, while others stay closer to familiar areas. We found that this is related to how well people understand the layout of the place. Importantly, we also found that personal attitudes toward orientation matter: people who feel more confident and enjoy exploring tend to revisit places less. On the other hand, the ability to mentally handle visual and spatial information (visuospatial working memory) doesn’t change how we explore, but it does help us build a better understanding of the environment. Gender and familiarity with using a joystick also related to how people explored and what they learned. By studying how people move and how this relates to their individual characteristics, we can better understand how we learn about the environments. © The Author(s) 2025.},

	abstract = {This study investigates the influence of emotional skills on employee turnover and organizational performance in Ghana’s budget hotel industry, where persistent staff attrition continues to undermine service delivery and operational efficiency. Using a validated questionnaire, data were collected from 422 employees across 51 budget hotels, producing strong reliability coefficients (0.70–0.88). Inferential statistical analyses, including the Kruskal–Wallis and Mann–Whitney U tests, show that employee performance is somewhat positively impacted by emotional abilities, particularly self-awareness, empathy, and emotional control. Employees who exhibit stronger emotional competencies demonstrate higher engagement levels, improved work attitudes, and an increased likelihood of remaining with their organizations. The findings underscore the need for hotel managers to prioritise emotional skills development as a strategic human-resource intervention to reduce turnover and enhance organizational effectiveness. Investing in targeted training, coaching, and supportive leadership practices can help develop these competencies, ultimately reducing operational disruptions caused by high employee mobility. Strengthening emotional competencies not only helps stabilise the workforce but also contributes to long-term sustainability, improved service quality, and greater competitiveness within Ghana’s budget hotel sector. © 2025 Journal of Organizational Behavior Research.},

	abstract = {The aim of this article is to address the current knowledge gap in key soft skills required when managing projects in an Industry 5.0 context. Using a survey questionnaire, key social, emotional, and behavioral skills were identified and framed through the theoretical lenses of the Big Five personality traits and Schwartz’s personal values theories. The findings highlight the growing relevance of emotional resilience, innovation, cooperation, and social engagement, reflecting personality qualities such as openness to experience and agreeableness and personal values such as self-direction, universalism, and hedonism. The professional identity of project managers is posited to evolve concomitantly. © 2025 Project Management Institute, Inc..
