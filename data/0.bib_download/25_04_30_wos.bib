Title = {Examining the effect of STEAM Maker Instruction (SMI) on socioemotional
   skills aptitude in multicultural and ethnically diverse undergraduate
   settings},

Abstract = {This study examined the impact of STEAM Maker Instruction (SMI) on the
   acquisition of a third language, and the development of socioemotional
   skills among multi-ethnic undergraduates (n = 265). By integrating the
   5E instructional model with 36 real-world business projects, this study
   aimed to bridge the gap between traditional multiethnic classrooms and
   societal expectations. Analysis of the data indicated that
   socioemotional skills are essential in managing students' anxiety and
   aspirations, which in turn fosters their creativity and academic
   performance in English for Specific Purposes (ESP). The 5E model
   significantly improved students' business knowledge, learning skills,
   and attitudes, including learning capacity, social interaction,
   self-regulation, open innovation, team collaboration, and creativity.
   Social interactions, which rely on self-regulation, self-management, and
   resilience, were found to be essential for fostering creativity. This
   study demonstrated that SMI can develop socioemotional skills through
   engagement with real-world business projects. It offers a pathway for
   multicultural classroom teaching by incorporating SMI into undergraduate
   curricula. Nonetheless, this study acknowledges certain limitations,
   such as the limited sample size and concentration in a specific academic
   field. Future research should explore the long-term effects of
   socio-emotional skills and academic outcomes beyond the classroom. This
   includes examining the relationships among emotional engagement,
   behavioral engagement, and self-efficacy in the context of career
   decision-making strategies.},

Title = {Differences in change goals between personality traits and social,

Journal = {PERSONALITY AND INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {241},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Although research suggests that most people want to change their
   personality traits, previous studies have neither explored whether
   individuals also desire to change the social, emotional, and behavioral
   (SEB) skills linked to those traits, nor whether people have different
   beliefs about the malleability of skills vs. traits. In the present
   within-person experiment, 264 young adults from the US and Italy rated
   their desire to change each of the Big Five personality traits and the
   corresponding domains of SEB skills. They also rated their beliefs about
   the feasibility, motivation, and impact of making these changes. Results
   showed that participants reported similar or higher scores for skills,
   compared to traits, across all measured outcomes. Specifically, scores
   for social engagement and self-management skills were consistently
   higher than those for extraversion and conscientiousness. These findings
   indicate that people believe it to be more desirable-and more
   feasible-to change some SEB skills than the corresponding personality
   traits.},

   low-empathic-tolerant (10\%), and high (3\%). Further analyses revealed
   that adolescents with high social and emotional skills generally
   reported higher educational aspirations, lower school anxiety, and
   perceived their relationships at school more positively. However,
   adolescents with empathic-stressed profile reported similarly high
   educational aspirations and high school anxiety. Girls were more likely

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Drawing on the nationally representative Longitudinal Study of Young
   People in England (LSYPE; n = 15,770), this study assesses the role of
   academic agency (an aspect of self-directed engagement with learning and
   education) in enabling socioeconomically disadvantaged youth to complete
   secondary education. Academic agency is operationalised as a
   multi-dimensional construct, comprising education expectations, academic
   self-concept, and school engagement. The findings suggest that academic
   agency can act as an independent resource, over and above family
   socioeconomic status (indicated by parental education and social class).
   There was also evidence of resource substitution, i.e., academic agency
   reduces the risk of low educational attainment for those with few family
   socioeconomic resources. Moreover, there is evidence of `ethnic capital'
   as ethnic minority youth with high academic expectations were more
   likely to achieve key educational milestones. The results are discussed
   regarding interlinked inequalities of sex, minority status, and family
   socioeconomic status.},

Month = {2025 APR 15},
Abstract = {Growing up is rarely easy, yet adolescents and young adults today are
   reporting distress at rates never seen before. We propose this trend can
   be traced to societal forces that accelerate and suppress development,
   resulting in developmental anxiety (i.e., worry about meeting adult
   milestones on time, if ever). Drawing on foundational theories from
   developmental and family sciences, we introduce hurries and waits as
   umbrella terms for these simultaneous and contradictory forces and
   explain how developmental anxiety may arise from the tension they place
   on young people. We next identify strengths that both young people and
   their families can use to navigate hurry-wait tension, and close with an
   agenda for future research. This updated, systems-based lens on the
   transition to adulthood prepares the field to help young people achieve
   the fulfilling adult life that previous generations looked forward to
   with greater promise.},

Title = {Association between urbanization levels and frailty among middle-aged
   and older adults in China: evidence from the CHARLS},
Journal = {BMC MEDICINE},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {23},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR 24},
Abstract = {Background Rapid urbanization is underway in China. However, the impact
   of urbanization on frailty remains unclear. This study aims to
   investigate the relationship between urbanization and frailty among
   middle-aged and older adults. Methods We analyzed nationally
   representative data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal
   Study (CHARLS) spanning 2011 to 2018. After applying inclusion and
   exclusion criteria, 10,758 non-frail individuals at baseline were
   analyzed. The exposure of interest was the comprehensive urbanization
   level. Urbanization level (0.072-0.689) was assessed using the entropy
   method. Frailty was assessed using the frailty index (FI), which ranges
   from 0 to 100. Frailty was defined as FI >= 25, and the
   urbanization-frailty association was assessed using - the restricted
   cubic spline (RCS) expressions and Cox proportional hazards models.
   Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression were
   employed to evaluate major factors associated with frailty. Results The
   results revealed a U-shaped nonlinear association between urbanization
   level and frailty incidence, with a turning point at 0.3 (P-nonlinear <
   0.001). In the Cox model, for urbanization scores below 0.3, each
   ten-percentile increase was associated with an HR of 0.871 (95\% CI
   0.843-0.900, P < 0.05). Conversely, scores at or above 0.3 had an HR of
   1.178 (95\% CI 1.053-1.319, P < 0.05) per ten-percentile increase. In
   the subgroup analysis of participants with urbanization scores below
   0.3, there was a significant interaction between current work status and
   subgroups with dyslipidemia. LASSO regression showed that, for
   urbanization scores < 0.3, total retail sales (coefficient = - 0.129)
   and per capita income (coefficient = - 0.071) were most protective
   against frailty. For scores >= 0.3, key urbanization factors associated
   with increased frailty risk included the number of college students per
   10,000 people (coefficient = 0.080) and the proportion of built-up land
   in the urban area (coefficient = 0.060). Conclusions Urbanization level
   had U-shaped association with frailty incidence. Factors such as total
   retail sales of consumer goods per capita, per capita disposable income
   of urban residents, and the number of college students per 10,000 people
   may be key in formulating a strategy for frailty prevention.},

   changes in secondary school students' important outcomes},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PERSONALITY},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 MAR 19},
Abstract = {Evidence across the social sciences suggests the importance of social,
   emotional, and behavioral (SEB) skills for a wide variety of youth
   outcomes. However, most of this work is cross-sectional. We know little
   about how patterns of change in adolescents' SEB skills may be related
   to commensurate patterns of change in important outcomes across an
   academic year. Drawing from a sample of American secondary school
   students (N = 942), this longitudinal study employs latent change score
   models to fill that gap. We report four key findings. We find that (1) a
   short version of the Behavioral, Emotional, and Social Skills Inventory
   (BESSI) is psychometrically suitable for longitudinal analyses. We
   further find that (2) SEB skills are highly stable, on average, but also
   (3) characterized by significant between-person variation in change.
   Centrally, we find that (4) positive changes in SEB skills are related
   to changes in academic engagement, friendship quality, anxiety,
   depression, life satisfaction, as well as other measures of social and
   emotional competencies. Taken together, the results suggest that SEB
   skills are malleable, but future work is needed to identify patterns of
   change and develop and test targeted interventions.},

   Skills},
Journal = {ECNU REVIEW OF EDUCATION},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 MAR 16},
Abstract = {Purpose This review paper addresses three major challenges hindering
   progress in the field of social-emotional learning in
   education.Design/Approach/Methods We first discuss how social-emotional
   skills could be conceptualized, contrasting identity versus
   self-efficacy approaches. Second, we argue to develop more objective
   assessments of social-emotional skills and their development, as a
   supplement of currently and frequently used self- and informant
   descriptions relying on Likert-based scales. Third and finally, we
   discuss recurrent issues that are raised when debating the
   implementation of social-emotional skill learning in the
   classroom.Findings The review suggests that, at this point in time, both
   self-efficacy and identity conceptualizations of social-emotional skills
   are valuable approaches. Future research will need to explore which
   conceptualization for which skills demonstrates the best predictive
   validity, taking into account the nature of outcomes and contexts. The
   desired characteristics of more objective social-emotional skill
   measures are defined, and we encourage to examine how these overlap with
   self-reports using construct maps. Finally, we underscore the importance
   of having a comprehensive and evidence-informed taxonomy of
   social-emotional skills to guide the debate on the inclusion of
   social-emotional skill learning in curricula and its implementation in
   the classroom.Originality/Value This short review is primarily written
   for practitioners and policymakers to give a quick and accessible update
   on the key challenges in social-emotional learning today. The review
   should trigger more in-depth reading on the topic, but also support
   readers to understand current problems and help them dealing with
   questions and potential objections that might be raised by different

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ADOLESCENCE},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 FEB 28},
Abstract = {Introduction: Transitioning from school to higher education or work is a
   pivotal moment in a student's life, requiring life-changing decisions.
   During this period, students who have acquired a wide range of Social,
   Emotional, and Behavioral (SEB) skills may feel more confident regarding
   their capacity to adapt positively to future challenges and
   difficulties. Our study aimed to test whether five SEB skills domains
   (self-management, innovation, social engagement, cooperation, and
   emotional resilience skills) were associated with four career
   adaptability resources (i.e., concern, control, curiosity, and
   confidence). Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 350
   Italian students (143 boys; Mage = 16.65) at the end of their last or
   penultimate year of high school (May-June 2024). We ran a multivariate
   regression analysis to examine specific associations between SEB skills
   domains and career adaptability resources. Furthermore, we tested a
   structural equation model including a latent factor of
   career-adaptability as the dependent variable, and SEB skills domains as
   predictors. Results: Our results showed that students who described
   themselves as more competent in self-management, innovation, and social
   engagement skills reported higher levels of career adaptability
   (considering both the latent factor and the specific resources).
   Conclusions: Our findings highlight the importance of feeling competent
   in different domains, not just academics, as the perception of having
   tools and skills could make students more confident in their ability to
   face future challenges and adapt to their future careers.},

Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {15},

Month = {FEB 20},
Abstract = {Emotion, a fundamental mapping of human responses to external stimuli,
   has been extensively studied in human-computer interaction, particularly
   in areas such as intelligent cockpits and systems. However, accurately
   recognizing emotions from facial expressions remains a significant
   challenge due to lighting conditions, posture, and micro-expressions.
   Emotion recognition using global or local facial features is a key
   research direction. However, relying solely on global or local features
   often results in models that exhibit uneven attention across facial
   features, neglecting key variations critical for detecting emotional
   changes. This paper proposes a method for modeling and extracting key
   facial features by integrating global and local facial data. First, we
   construct a comprehensive image preprocessing model that includes
   super-resolution processing, lighting and shading processing, and
   texture enhancement. This preprocessing step significantly enriches the
   expression of image features. Second, A global facial feature
   recognition model is developed using an encoder-decoder architecture,
   which effectively eliminates environmental noise and generates a
   comprehensive global feature dataset for facial analysis.
   Simultaneously, the Haar cascade classifier is employed to extract
   refined features from key facial regions, including the eyes, mouth, and
   overall face, resulting in a corresponding local feature dataset.
   Finally, a two-branch convolutional neural network is designed to
   integrate both global and local facial feature datasets, enhancing the
   model's ability to recognize facial characteristics accurately. The
   global feature branch fully characterizes the global features of the
   face, while the local feature branch focuses on the local features. An
   adaptive fusion module integrates the global and local features,
   enhancing the model's ability to differentiate subtle emotional changes.
   To evaluate the accuracy and robustness of the model, we train and test
   it on the FER-2013 and JAFFE emotion datasets, achieving average
   accuracies of 80.59\% and 97.61\%, respectively. Compared to existing
   state-of-the-art models, our refined face feature extraction and fusion
   model demonstrates superior performance in emotion recognition.
   Additionally, the comparative analysis shows that emotional features
   across different faces show similarities. Building on psychological
   research, we categorize the dataset into three emotion classes:
   positive, neutral, and negative. The accuracy of emotion recognition is
   significantly improved under the new classification criteria.
   Additionally, the self-built dataset is used to validate further that
   this classification approach has important implications for practical
   applications.},

Title = {Digitally assessing social-emotional skills in early school years:
   initial validation of a screening instrument},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {16},
Month = {FEB 6},
Abstract = {Introduction Social-emotional skills are essential in everyday
   interaction and develop in early and middle childhood. However, there is
   no German instrument to help primary school students identify their
   strengths and weaknesses in different social-emotional skills that does
   not rely on written language. This paper introduces a new digital
   instrument, the GraSEF: Grazer Screening to assess Social-Emotional
   Skills, which was developed to measure (1) Behavior in Social
   Situations, (2) Prosocial Behavior, (3) Emotion Regulation Strategies,
   (4) Emotion Recognition and (5) Self-Perception of Emotions using
   different test formats (e.g., situational judgement test,
   self-assessment, performance tests). In the GraSEF, students work
   through an online survey tool, using audio instructions to guide them
   through the test.Methods The present study analyses the responses of
   second graders (Mage = 8.23 years, SDage = 0.48, 48\% female). The
   intention was to gain initial insight into the instrument's psychometric
   quality and user-friendliness.Results In general, the instrument was
   found to have acceptable to good internal consistency, sufficient
   discriminatory power and item difficulty. However, one subtest (5:
   Self-Perception of Emotions), as well as three situations of the
   situational judgment test (1: Behavior in Social Situations), were
   excluded due to unsatisfactory fit and distribution. The validity check
   revealed low to moderate correlations between teacher rating and student
   scores. On average, students completed the screening in about 30 min and
   provided positive feedback regarding usability.Discussion While the
   small sample size only provides preliminary insight into the
   instrument's psychometric quality, the results suggest that the GraSEF
   can reliably measure various dimensions of social-emotional skills in
   second graders, even among those with low reading skills.},

Abstract = {Teachers' social and emotional competences (SEC) are important both for
   their well-being and for children's development. Although there are
   self-report instruments that assess teachers' SEC, only the TRUST
   assesses them directly through challenging secondary school classroom

   to adapt it and validate it for primary school teachers, in Catalan
   language. A total of 143 teachers responded to a sociodemographic
   questionnaire, to an adaptation of the TRUST for primary school teachers
   (TRUST-PS), and to an emotional intelligence questionnaire (TEIQue-SF).
   The results revealed that the TRUST-PS has an adequate internal
   consistency for their two subtests: emotion regulation (alpha = .83) and
   relationship management (alpha = .87). Also, a two-factor model showed
   good fit to the data. In conclusion, the TRUST-PS can be used to
   directly assess primary school teachers' SEC and be helpful for

Abstract = {Is Conscientiousness a useful construct across cultures? Using the 2012
   Program for International Student Assessment data, we examined whether
   perseverance, a measure of Conscientiousness, was related to achievement
   and truancy across 62 countries/regions (N > 470,000). We investigated
   whether these relationships were linear or curvilinear in nature and
   assessed the utility of item-level information. After establishing
   partial metric invariance of the perseverance measure across various
   countries/regions and cultural regions, our findings unveiled that
   perseverance consistently predicted both math achievement and truancy,
   with predominantly linear associations. Notably, among the five items of
   the Perseverance scale, the item reflecting one's tendency to give up
   easily in the face of challenges emerged as the strongest and most
   consistent predictor of math achievement. Further, country-level
   correlations between perseverance and both math achievement and truancy
   displayed contradictory patterns compared to individual-level
   correlations, suggesting the presence of biasing factors in how people
   respond to these measures. Nonetheless, it appears reasonable to
   conclude that measures of Conscientiousness are pan-cultural predictors
   of achievement and truancy.},
