Using bifactor exploratory structural equation modelling, we examined five dimensions of PSEC (perceived competence for assertiveness, tolerance, social regulation, emotion regulation, and emotional awareness), identifying a global factor and five specific factors. Following that, we employed structural equation modelling to investigate links between these global and specific factors and five parent-reported social-emotional skills: leadership, cultural competence, teamwork, cognitive reappraisal, and capacity for emotional reflection. Global PSEC was associated positively with all skills, whereas the specific factors were, with one exception, each associated with greater parent-rated skill in a corresponding area (e.g., assertiveness with greater leadership skill;exclude

However, literature on the topic relied on different frameworks and questionable measurement methods. Additionally, they usually did not integrate skills into classical self-regulated learning (SRL) frameworks. To overcome these limitations, we adopted the new integrative SEB framework and measured SEB skills, along with five SRL factors (academic self-efficacy, SRL strategies, mastery learning goals, growth mindset, and achievement emotions) and three outcomes (i.e., self-reported academic achievement, peer acceptance, and life satisfaction).

However, some resilient students are able to break from this mold and achieve high levels of academic performance. Rooted in the Big Five Theory, this study examined the extent to which socio-emotional skills (i.e., task performance, openmindedness, collaboration, engagement with others, and emotional regulation) are associated with academic resilience. Participants were 60,722 economically disadvantaged students from 31 countries/regions. Multilevel logistic regression was conducted. The results indicated that the socio-emotional skills of perseverance (task performance), curiosity (open-mindedness), and emotional control (emotional regulation) were positively associated with academic resilience. Surprisingly, cooperation was negatively associated with resilience, while empathy, assertiveness and stress resistance were not significantly associated with resilience. This study enriches the extant literature by demonstrating the critical role of socio-emotional skills in academic resilience. Additionally, it offers potential intervention targets that might be leveraged to promote resilience among disadvantaged populations. Educational relevance statement: Socio-emotional skills play a crucial role in fostering academic resilience across the globe. Students from disadvantaged backgrounds who exhibit higher levels of perseverance (task performance), curiosity (open-mindedness), and emotional control (emotional regulation) are more likely to achieve better academic outcomes. This study highlights the potential of schools to promote academic resilience by developing students' socio-emotional skills.;include

Fifteen skills were examined, including assertiveness, cooperation, creativity, curiosity, emotional control, empathy, energy, optimism, persistence, responsibility, self-control, sociability, stress resistance, tolerance, and trust. Using network analysis, this study identified that cooperation and optimism were consistently among the most central skills, although the degree of their centrality varied across different age groups and cities. In contrast, energy showed weaker connections to other skills among 10-year-olds but stronger connections among 15-year-old in every city. The networks of children and adolescents differed in overall structure and in the global strength of skill interconnections, both in cross-city and most city-specific comparisons. The transition from childhood to adolescence is marked not only by differences in the importance of specific skills, but also by changes in the interactions among them.;exclude

Technology advancement is also an essential component of VR development. However, the literature needs to contain more studies on using VR as an assistive tool for skill development. This study aims to explore the impact of VR technological advancements on skill development through UX design taxonomies using a Systematic Literature Review (SLR). Skill development classification was conducted based on social, emotional, and behavioral (SEB) aspects. The selected studies that met the eligibility selection criteria were examined and synthesized. The study's findings highlight the necessity of technology development for VR technology to accomplish UX for skill development, allowing them to become more self-sufficient. This research can enrich researchers and VR developers, particularly software, hardware, and artificial intelligence (AI) experts. More research should be conducted on the long-term use of VR as an assistive device, particularly for those seeking skill improvement to improve their quality of life.;include

Associations Between the Big Five Soft Skills and Career and Academic Success;Soft skills are job-related resources associated with emotions, thoughts, and behaviors. The Big Five Soft Skills model describes the five domains: Extraversion (at work), Social Competence (agreeableness at work), Discipline (conscientiousness at work), Resilience (emotional stability at work), and Intellectual Flexibility (openness at work). We used two heterogeneous samples (N = 262 and N = 290) to demonstrate that self-rated soft skills are related to outcomes such as educational attainment, income, health, job satisfaction, turnover intentions, and burnout risk, in some cases beyond cognitive abilities and personality traits. We employed a student sample (N = 262) to show that self-rated soft skills can predict academic grades, even when students are instructed to respond as they would in a job-application situation. The results also show that describing specific facets vs. global domains (e. g., sociability, assertiveness, enthusiasm vs. global extraversion) enables a better prediction of external criteria and a deeper understanding of associations between soft skills and outcome variables.;include

The questionnaire survey conducted among 161 Czech students in December 2023 was based on Goleman's EI test. He divided EI into five essential competencies: self-awareness, managing emotions, motivating oneself, empathy and social skills. Using cluster analysis, students were further divided into three groups based on their self-assessment in the five listed categories. The relevance of individual competencies was also compared with employers' requirements for career skills. This analysis was based on a survey carried out as part of the World Economic Forum in 2023. From the overall assessment, it can be concluded that future employees (current students) feel most strongly about self-awareness and empathy.

The sample included 7731 10-year-olds and 7430 15-year-olds from 10 cities across nine countries. Empathy and cooperation were identified as the most central skills in the network of high-achieving 10-year-olds, while cooperation uniquely remained central among 15-year-olds. We also observed denser and more integrated network structures in adolescence. These findings highlight the importance of central skills, particularly cooperation and empathy, in fostering social-emotional competence through developmentally tailored educational programmes.;exclude

Both are conceptualized as more competence-like than solely trait-like. It has rarely been investigated (1) whether these constructs might assess the same latent dimension, and (2) if they indeed reflect competencies beyond traits. In three samples (N = 592), we observed (1) high convergence between all constructs.

However, whether and to what extent these socioeconomic gaps extend to the domain of socio-emotional skills is still relatively underexplored. Furthermore, limited research has examined the potential mechanisms that might help explain this relationship. To address these gaps, this study investigated socioeconomic gaps in socio-emotional skills and whether school-based interpersonal relationships may help explain their association. The participants were 31,187 10-year-old and 29,798 15-year-old students from ten cities across nine countries. The Big Five framework, which organizes skills into five broad domains and more specific facets was used to classify socio-emotional skills. The results of multilevel structural equation modeling indicated that socioeconomic gaps were present in eight out of the 15 socio-emotional skills more specifically, we found socioeconomic gaps in persistence, emotional control, empathy, trust, tolerance, creativity, sociability, and assertiveness. However, we did not find gaps in self-control, responsibility, stress resistance, optimism, cooperation, curiosity, and energy. At a broader level, there seem to be more differences in the domains of collaboration and social engagement compared to emotion regulation and task performance. Empathy, trust, sociability, and assertiveness showed the strongest disparities among students from different economic strata. School-based interpersonal relationships partly explained these gaps. Students from more advantaged families experienced more positive school-based interpersonal relationships, which in turn, facilitated higher socio-emotional skills. The theoretical and practical implications are discussed.;exclude

Traditionally, research has focused on differences in mean levels of behavior across situations and time, rather than taking a situation-specific approach to variability. These approaches neglect variability (or the opposite, consistency) within a situation, often treating within-situation variability as mere error. This study investigates three primary questions involving behavioral variability: (a) Is variability a general characteristic of individuals or contingent on situational factors? (b) Do situations influence behavioral variability either by allowing for more behavioral variability or by increasing behavioral consistency? (c) Do personality traits interact with situations to affect variability? Utilizing intensive longitudinal data from two studies, we developed a novel person-in-situ density distribution model to capture person-specific within-situation variability. Our findings indicate that behavioral variability is not solely a function of individual differences but also significantly shaped by situational contexts. Meanwhile, contrary to the strong situation hypothesis, which emphasizes that situations tend to constrain behaviors, the present study found situations influence behavioral variability in both directions, making people more and less variable. Finally, personality traits were found to moderate the impact of situations on behavioral consistency, suggesting that variability reflects the interplay between person and situation factors. These results highlight the importance of considering behavioral variability within situations, which offers insights into personality dynamics rather than exclusively focusing on mean-level analyses. The implications of the person-in-situ density distribution model for studying person-situation transactions are also discussed.;include

The neuroeducational framework integrates neuroscience with pedagogical practice to understand how linguistically and culturally rich environments drive neuroplasticity and cognitive adaptation in adult learners. Objective: This systematic review synthesizes findings from 80 studies examining neuroplasticity and cognitive outcomes in adults undergoing multicultural and second-language acquisition, focusing on underlying neural mechanisms and educational effectiveness. Methods: The analysis included randomized controlled trials and longitudinal studies employing diverse neuroimaging techniques (fMRI, MEG, DTI) to assess structural and functional brain network changes. Interventions varied in terms of immersion intensity (ranging from limited classroom contact to complete environmental immersion), multimodal approaches (integrating visual, auditory, and kinesthetic elements), feedback mechanisms (immediate vs. delayed, social vs. automated), and learning contexts (formal instruction, naturalistic acquisition, and technology-enhanced environments). Outcomes encompassed cognitive domains (executive function, working memory, attention) and socio-emotional processes (empathy, cultural adaptation). Results: Strong evidence demonstrates that multicultural and second-language acquisition induce specific neuroplastic adaptations, including enhanced connectivity between language and executive networks, increased cortical thickness in frontal-temporal regions, and white matter reorganization supporting processing efficiency. These neural changes are correlated with significant improvements in working memory, attentional control, and cognitive flexibility. Immersion intensity, multimodal design features, learning context, and individual differences, including age and sociocultural background, moderate the effectiveness of interventions across adult populations. Conclusions: Adult multicultural and second-language acquisition represents a biologically aligned educational approach that leverages natural neuroplastic mechanisms to enhance cognitive resilience. Findings support the design of interventions that engage integrated neural networks through rich, culturally relevant environments, with significant implications for cognitive health across the adult lifespan and for evidence-based educational practice.;exclude

Participants were randomly selected from 2 basketball sports schools chosen from a list of basketball sports schools and divided into experimental (n = 30) and control (n = 32) groups. The experimental group participants were subjected to the effect of the positive behavior skills development program, which aimed to develop positive behavior skills among adolescents participating in basketball sports schools, including taking responsibility, positive self-evaluation, prosocial behavior with teammates, prosocial behavior with opponents, taking social responsibility, cooperation, assertiveness, empathy, self-control, ability to evaluate and convey emotions, ability to utilize one's positive emotional experience, ability to comprehend and analyze emotions, and ability to control emotions. Positive behavior skills development activities were conducted by one of the researchers together with the sports school coaches.

This randomized controlled trial innovatively examined to what extent effects of such an intervention generalize to broader domains. The new socioemotional competence training (SECT), designed to improve social and emotional functioning and well-being in healthy adults, consists of eight weekly 2-hr sessions and was conducted in three cohorts. We collected data on both specific outcomes that were directly targeted during the training (i.e., mindfulness, perceived stress) and broader psychological indicators of emotional and social functioning (e.g., self-compassion, empathy, perspective taking, well-being) before, during, and after the training, with follow-ups after 3 and 12 months. Participants were 166 young (19-39 years, M = 28.16, SD = 4.7) and older (50-78 years, M = 63.55, SD = 7.2) healthy German adults (75.2\% female). Of these, 73 and 54 participants were randomly allocated to the socioemotional competence training or to a waitlist control group, respectively. Thirty-nine participants were allocated to the last training cohort. Results of the mixed effects models showed significant Group-by-Time effects on mindfulness (b = 0.28, 95\% CI {[}0.16, 0.40]), perceived stress (b = -0.36, 95\% CI {[}-0.56, -0.16]), and well-being (b = 0.43, 95\% CI {[}0.09, 0.78]), but no meaningful effects on the other broader outcomes. Training effects were stable across 3- to 12-months follow-up. The socioemotional competence training yielded specific improvements in characteristics that were explicitly and consistently addressed throughout the training. This underscores the importance of tailored interventions in promoting specific aspects of socioemotional well-being. Public Significance Statement This study shows that participation in a structured 8-week socioemotional competence training improves participants' mindfulness, perceived stress, and well-being for up to 1 year after completion. This finding indicates that the socioemotional competence training can help healthy adults develop social and emotional skills to resiliently manage daily hassles such as daily stress or challenging social interactions.;exclude

This study thus aimed to fill this gap and to identify the most important skills in three representative countries in education: China, USA, and Finland. Drawing data from OECD Social-emotional Skills Survey study, about 20,000 students from three countries (NChina = 7246, NUSA = 6434 and NFinland = 5482) were included in this study. The Relative Weights Analysis and the Dominance Analysis were conducted to identify critical socialemotional skills. Results showed that, after controlling for demographical variables, in general, curiosity, persistence and responsibility were the most important skills for students' learning outcomes, while optimism, energy, and stress resistance were the three most crucial skills relating to students' well-being. However, there was also context-specific finding for achievement: tolerance was critical for US students' academic achievement while assertiveness and creativity were most important for Chinese students' achievements.

Comparing the Susceptibility and Mechanisms of Faking Across Self-Reports, Human Interview Ratings, and AI Interview Ratings;Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly used to score employment interviews in the early stages of the hiring process, but AI algorithms may be particularly prone to interviewee faking. Our study compared the extent to which people can improve their scores on self-report scales, structured and less structured human interview ratings, and AI interview ratings. Further, we replicate and extend prior research by examining how interviewee abilities and impression management tactics influence score inflation across scoring methods. Participants (N = 152) completed simulated, asynchronous interviews in honest and applicant-like conditions in a within-subjects design. The AI algorithms in the study were trained to replicate question-level structured interview ratings. Participants' scores increased most on self-reports (overall Cohen's d = 0.62) and least on AI interview ratings (overall Cohen's d = 0.14), although AI score increases were similar to those observed for human interview ratings (overall Cohen's d = 0.22). On average, across conditions, AI interview ratings converged more strongly with structured human ratings based on behaviorally anchored rating scales than with less structured human ratings. Verbal ability only predicted score improvement on self-reports, while increased use of honest defensive impression management tactics predicted improvement in AI and less structured human interview scores. Ability to identify criteria did not predict score improvement. Overall, these AI interview scores behaved similarly to structured human ratings. We discuss future possibilities for investigating faking in AI interviews, given that interviewees may try to ``game{''} the system when aware that they are being evaluated by AI.;exclude

However, how individuals' socio-emotional skills modify these experiences remains unclear. This study conducted a survey of 1,422 Chinese university students and applied network analysis and latent profile analysis to explore the relationship between socio-emotional skills and online social experiences. The results showed that socio-emotional skills had a significant positive correlation with positive online social experiences and a significant negative correlation with negative online social experiences. Among these skills, stress resilience may serve as a key dimension for enhancing overall socio-emotional competence. Therefore, interventions targeting stress resilience could be particularly effective in helping individuals strengthen their broader socio-emotional skills, thereby improving their online social experiences. Additionally, the study found that positive and negative online social experiences are two distinct constructs, suggesting that intervention strategies should address them separately. These findings provide a theoretical foundation for developing targeted interventions to improve young people's online social experiences and promote their mental well-being.;include

A sequential explanatory research design was employed, involving 139 participants from two different language programs, English Language Teaching and Turkish Language Teaching, at a university in Turkey. The quantitative data obtained through the SEL scale revealed that participants exhibited strong skills in problem-solving and relationship-building but demonstrated a moderate level of self-awareness. Additionally, their stress management skills were found to be underdeveloped. Qualitative analysis further revealed that essential SEL competencies, such as emotion regulation and anger management, were limited, and participants frequently relied on avoidance strategies for stress management. This study highlights that SEL strategies should be incorporated into teacher education programs to better prepare teacher candidates for the complexities of teaching and learning environments while promoting their overall well-being. The study concludes with recommendations for the inclusion of SEL interventions in teacher training curricula to enhance pre-service teachers' social and emotional competence in their professional lives.;exclude

Too many institutions limit their accountability to enforcing formal rules and regulations. This undermines their everyday functioning, institutional integrity, and public trust. In so doing, they fail to honor their own educational, research, and service missions. Institutional accountability for research integrity means going beyond enforcing regulations, teaching required responsible conduct of research courses, and responding to allegations of misconduct. It means recognizing and acting upon the knowledge that researchers' interpersonal conduct is crucial for creating and sustaining productive and healthy work environments, and that work environments often dictate the norms and behaviors that create (or undermine) a strong culture of research integrity within an institution. Everyday actions of setting the tone, defining success, articulating values and expectations, and providing resources are crucial foundations of an institutional working culture that consistently values rigor, reproducibility, belonging, and integrity. Providing and normalizing engaging, relevant professional development programs is one way to be proactive about supporting all organizational members to be accountable for work cultures that buttress research integrity.;exclude

First, the requirements for such a model were formulated, followed by an analysis of personality models in the DSM-5 and ICD-11 regarding their applicability to positive clinical psychology. As a result, issues were identified that the Circumplex of Personality Metatraits seems to address. Materials and methods: Five requirements for a personality model useful in positive clinical psychology were articulated: (1) integration of knowledge from positive clinical psychology and personality psychology, (2) relative independence from theoretical paradigms, (3) applicability of the model in diagnosis, (4) applicability of the model in therapy, and (5) applicability of the model in positive interventions and prevention. Results: Personality models based on the Big Five introduced in the DSM-5 and ICD-11 for the conceptualisation and diagnosis of personality disorders can be interpreted as an application of the principles of positive clinical psychology in this area. However, these models (1) inherit certain issues associated with the Big Five in personality psychology, and (2) their application to clinical psychology introduces additional problems, which means they fail to meet the formulated requirements for such a model, thereby limiting their potential for positive clinical psychology. Conclusions: The Circumplex of Personality Metatraits overcomes these problems, aligns well with the principles of positive clinical psychology, and meets the specified requirements for a model needed in this field.;exclude

Despite evidence on the ability of professional prequalification and SJT performance to predict general interpersonal skills, their benefit for students' concrete behavior in everyday situations remains unclear. Methods: With the present study, we examined how undergraduate medical students with prior professional qualification and students with better SJT performance act in actual social situations by using a behavior-focused observer approach. Supervisors rated the students after a mandatory one-week practical training in general medicine on three distinguishable interpersonal dimensions, namely agency (i.e., assured-dominant), communion (i.e., warm-agreeable), and emotional stability (i.e., calm and stable). Prior to admission, participants (N = 210) completed a traditional SJT (i.e., HAM-SJT), a natural science test (i.e., HAM-Nat), and responded to sociodemographic questions. Results: Controlling for cognitive admission criteria, age, and gender, students with prior professional qualifications were rated as more assured-dominant (/3 = 0.21;exclude
