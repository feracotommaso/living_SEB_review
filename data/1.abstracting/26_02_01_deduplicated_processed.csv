Results indicated that more skilled students participated in volunteering, but volunteering, in general, did not predict positive SEB skill change. However, participants who reported interacting with others while volunteering experienced growth in socially relevant skills. Participants who reported positive subjective evaluations of volunteering also experienced growth in several SEB skills. These findings suggest that domain relevant actions, as well as subjective experiences of engaging in those actions, may be critical for positive SEB skill development. © 2026 Elsevier Inc.;include

Significant individual differences exist, particularly in the ability to develop survey knowledge—a map-like understanding of spatial relationships. While many studies have focused on navigation via predetermined routes, less is known about individual differences in learning environments from free exploration. This study investigated whether exploration behaviors, such as the tendency to revisit places or diffuse in the environment, are linked to mental representations and whether visuospatial factors, like visuospatial working memory and self-reported wayfinding inclinations (e.g., self-efficacy and pleasure in exploring, and spatial anxiety), contribute to these relationships. A sample of 234 participants (147 womencompleted a visuospatial working memory task and wayfinding questionnaires, then freely explored a virtual city in a CAVE environment. Revisiting (tendency to re-explore visited areas) and diffusion (extent of environmental coverage) were calculated. Their survey knowledge was assessed using a map drawing task. The results showed that exploration behaviors were related to individual differences: women exhibited less revisiting and diffusion than men;exclude

Using a validated questionnaire, data were collected from 422 employees across 51 budget hotels, producing strong reliability coefficients (0.70–0.88). Inferential statistical analyses, including the Kruskal–Wallis and Mann–Whitney U tests, show that employee performance is somewhat positively impacted by emotional abilities, particularly self-awareness, empathy, and emotional control. Employees who exhibit stronger emotional competencies demonstrate higher engagement levels, improved work attitudes, and an increased likelihood of remaining with their organizations. The findings underscore the need for hotel managers to prioritise emotional skills development as a strategic human-resource intervention to reduce turnover and enhance organizational effectiveness. Investing in targeted training, coaching, and supportive leadership practices can help develop these competencies, ultimately reducing operational disruptions caused by high employee mobility. Strengthening emotional competencies not only helps stabilise the workforce but also contributes to long-term sustainability, improved service quality, and greater competitiveness within Ghana’s budget hotel sector. © 2025 Journal of Organizational Behavior Research.;include

A. and Asselmann, Eva;Personality-job fit in terms of the Big Five across the professional lifespan;Finding a job that fits is widely recognized as important for personal fulfillment and professional success. Despite the long history of person-environment fit research, surprisingly little is known about person-job fit in terms of basic personality traits. This study examined three basic tenets of fit theory regarding personality-job fit: Fit (1) is pleasurable, (2) regulated by individuals, and (3) changes over time. We hypothesized that personality-job fit would be associated with higher subjective well-being (RQ1), predict less occupational change (RQ2), and vary across the professional lifespan (RQ3). Fit was conceptualized as ``broad congruence{''} between individuals' Big Five trait levels and expert-rated trait demands of their occupations. We used nationally representative data from German jobholders (N = 18,712-30,883). Multilevel polynomial regression and response surface analysis showed no significant congruence effects but some interactions: More extraverted and open individuals felt better and were less likely to leave their jobs when these traits were strongly demanded by their work, though these outcomes were not optimized at exact personality-job fit. Additionally, personality-job fit improved over time, showing a linear increase across the lifespan. These findings emphasize studying fit theories in detail and considering individuals' personalities, such as being communicative or original, in career choice.;include

This trend study used independent samples of adolescents, collected annually from 2021 to 2024. The data collection instrument was the Agreeableness Scale from the Semente Panel of Socioemotional Skills. We conducted comparative analyses to identify significant differences in the scores of overall agreeableness and its subcomponents, based on the year of data collection, educational level (upper elementary school vs. high school), and gender. We observed a significant drop in agreeableness scores in 2022 and 2023, a period marked by the prolonged impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2024, we identified a recovery in the levels of this skill. Students in upper elementary school had higher agreeableness scores compared to those in high school. Regarding gender, female high school students showed higher levels of empathy and respect, while upper elementary school students showed greater trust.The socioemotional skills analyzed were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and showed changes over time, according to the education level and gender. The results support the importance of promoting educational interventions aimed at strengthening socioemotional development, especially in times of crisis, to foster students' social adaptation.;include
