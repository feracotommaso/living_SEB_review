The sample included 731 teachers at Wave 1 and 1131 teachers at Wave 2, with 370 teachers participating in both waves. Results showed that teachers' SEMC positively predicted their teaching of SEMC, mediated by perception of the importance of promoting SEMC and planning of the teaching of SEMC. Findings suggest the need to develop specific teacher training to promote these competencies among students.;include

Significant individual differences exist, particularly in the ability to develop survey knowledge-a map-like understanding of spatial relationships. While many studies have focused on navigation via predetermined routes, less is known about individual differences in learning environments from free exploration. This study investigated whether exploration behaviors, such as the tendency to revisit places or diffuse in the environment, are linked to mental representations and whether visuospatial factors, like visuospatial working memory and self-reported wayfinding inclinations (e.g., self-efficacy and pleasure in exploring, and spatial anxiety), contribute to these relationships. A sample of 234 participants (147 womencompleted a visuospatial working memory task and wayfinding questionnaires, then freely explored a virtual city in a CAVE environment. Revisiting (tendency to re-explore visited areas) and diffusion (extent of environmental coverage) were calculated. Their survey knowledge was assessed using a map drawing task. The results showed that exploration behaviors were related to individual differences: women exhibited less revisiting and diffusion than men;exclude

We draw on theories of technology adoption and research in affective computing, social psychology, and management to introduce the concept of human-AI relationships involving interdependence, temporality, and intensity. We develop the Relational Tradeoff Model, extending current theorizing on technology adoption by accounting for a critical third factor in addition to cognitive acceptance and behavioral use: human subjective well-being. The model reveals an important unexplored tradeoff in relationships with socially interactive AI: short-term acceptance and use gains but long-term subjective well-being costs for trust, psychological safety, and emotional labor, depending on AI social function and exacerbating and mitigating individual and relational factors. We discuss implications and suggestions for future exploration, including intrapersonal, interpersonal, and team relational dynamics and evolving expectations of AI in organizations.;exclude
